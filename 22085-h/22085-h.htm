<li>Typos and spelling variants (including hyphenated words) have been
checked against the Oxford English Dictionary (online edition, July
2007) and corrected as needed. Archaic spellings have been retained. In
rare cases, where a word replacement or correction was either uncertain
or impossible, the word was identified with [<i>sic.</i>]</li>
<li>Reference on 168 to the "The Presidency College Magazine"
must be to the second issue, as the 25th issue was in 1939 as
the events mentioned on p. 168 happened in 1915.</li>
<li>By-lines after various sections sometimes show as "Patrika," and at
other times as "A. B. Patrika." A. B. Patrika is not a person, but is
rather "Amrita Bazar Patrika," an English language daily newspaper
in India. To reduce confusion I have standardized the by-lines to

<font face="@Arial Unicode MS">SIR JAGADIS CHUNDER
BOSE</font></p>
<p class="indent">On the 30th November, 1858, Jagadis Chunder was
born, in a respectable Hindu family, which hails from village
Rarikhal, situated in the Vikrampur Pargana of the Dacca
District, in Bengal. He passed his boyhood at Faridpur, where his
father, the late Babu Bhugwan Chunder Bose, a member of the
<i>then</i> Subordinate Executive Service was the Sub-Divisional
Officer; and it was there that he derived "the power and strength
that nerved him to meet the shocks of life."<a href="#_1_" name=
"f1" id="f1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
HIS FATHER</p>
<p class="indent">His father was a fine product of the Western
Education in our country. Speaking of him, says Sir Jagadis "My
father was one of the earliest to receive the impetus
characteristic of the modern epoch as derived from the West. And
in his case it came to pass that the stimulus evoked the latent
potentialities of his race for evolving modes of expression
demanded by the period of transition in which he was placed. They
found expression in great constructive work, in the restoration
of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_002" id=
"Page_002">[Pg_002]</a></span>quiet amidst disorder, in the
earliest effort to spread education both among men and women, in
questions of social welfare, in industrial efforts, in the
establishment of people's bank and in the foundation of
industrial and technical schools."<a href="#_2_" name="f2" id=
"f2"><sup>2</sup></a> However, his efforts&mdash;like most
pioneer efforts&mdash;failed. He became overpowered in the
struggle. But his young son, who witnessed the struggle, derived
a great lesson which enabled him "to look on success or failure
as one"&mdash;or rather "failure as the antecedent power which
lies dormant for the long subsequent dynamic expression in what
we call success." "And if my life" says Sir Jagadis "in any way
came to be fruitful, then that came through the realisation of
this lesson."<a href="#_2_" name="f2a" id="f2a"><sup>2</sup></a>
So great was the influence exerted on him by his father that Sir
Jagadis Chunder has observed "To me his life had been one of
blessing and daily thanksgiving."<a href="#_2_" name="f2b" id=
"f2b"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
HIS EARLY EDUCATION</p>
<p class="indent">Little Jagadis received his first lesson in a
village <i>pathsala</i>. His father, who had very advanced views
in educational matters, instead of sending him to an English
School, which was then regarded as the only place for efficient
instruction, sent him to the vernacular village school for his
early education. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_003" id=
"Page_003">[Pg_003]</a></span>"While my father's subordinates"
says Sir Jagadis "sent their children to the English schools
intended for gentle folks, I was sent to the vernacular school,
where my comrades were hardy sons of toilers and of others who,
it is now fashion to regard, were belonging to the depressed
classes."<a href="#_3_" name="f3" id="f3"><sup>3</sup></a>
Speaking of the effect it produced on him, observes Sir Jagadis
"From these who tilled the ground and made the land blossom with
green verdure and ripening corn, and the sons of the fisher folk,
who told stories of the strange creatures that frequented unknown
depths of mighty rivers and stagnant pools, I first derived the
lesson of that which constitutes true manhood. From them too I
drew my love of nature."<a href="#_3_" name="f3a" id=
"f3a"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">"I now realise" continues Sir Jagadis "the
object of my being sent at the most plastic period of my life to
the vernacular school where I was to learn my own thoughts and to
receive the heritage of our national culture through the medium
of our own literature. I was thus to consider myself one with the
people and never to place myself in an equivocal position of
assumed superiority."<a href="#_3_" name="f3b" id=
"f3b"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">"The moral education which we received in our
childhood" adds Sir Jagadis "was very indirect and came from
listening to stories recited by the <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_004" id=
"Page_004">[Pg_004]</a></span>"Kathaks" on various incidents
connected with our great epics. Their effects on our mind was
Very great."<a href="#_4_" name="f4" id="f4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">And it is very interesting to learn from the
lips of Sir Jagadis himself "that the inventive bent of his mind
received its first impetus" in the industrial and technical
schools established by his father.<a href="#_4_" name="f4a" id=
"f4a"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
HIS COLLEGIATE EDUCATION IN INDIA</p>
<p class="indent">After he had developed, in the <i>pathsala</i>,
some power of observation, some power of reasoning and some power
of expression through the healthy medium of his own mother
tongue, young Jagadis was sent to an English School for
education. He passed the Entrance Examination, in 1875, from the
St. Xavier's Collegiate School, Calcutta, in the First Division.
He then joined the College classes of that Institution, and
there, in the "splendid museum of Physical Science Instruments,"
he drew his early inspirations in Physics from that remarkable
educationist and brilliant experimentalist, the Rev. Father E.
Lefont, S.J., C.I.E., M.I.E.E., who had the rare gift of
enkindling the imagination of his pupils. He passed the First
Examination in Arts, in 1877, in the Second Division and the B.A.
Examination by the B. Course (Science Course), in 1880, in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_005" id=
"Page_005">[Pg_005]</a></span>Second Division. "It is the
paramount duty of the University" says Sir Ashutosh Mookerjea "to
discover and develop unusual talent."<a href="#_5_" name="f5" id=
"f5"><sup>5</sup></a> The Calcutta University, by the test of
examination which it applied, totally failed to <i>discover</i>
(not to speak of <i>developing</i>) the powers of an original
mind which was destined to enrich the world by giving away the
fruits of its experience.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
HIS STUDY ABROAD</p>
<p class="indent">After Jagadis had graduated himself, in the
Calcutta University, he longed to get a course of scientific
education in England. He was sent to Cambridge and joined the
Christ's College. He came in "personal contact with eminent men,
whose influence extorted his admiration and created in him a
feeling of emulation. In the way he owed a great deal to Lord
Rayleigh, under whom he worked."<a href=
"#_6_" name="f6" id="f6"><sup>6</sup></a> He passed the B.A.
Examination of the Cambridge University, in Natural Science
Tripos, in 1884. He also secured, in 1883, the B.Sc. Degree with
Honours of London University. Jagadis had, by birth, the
speculative Indian mind. And, by his scientific education, at
home and abroad, he developed a capacity for accurate experiment
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_006" id=
"Page_006">[Pg_006]</a></span>and observation and learnt to
control his Imagination&mdash;"that wonderous faculty which, left
to ramble uncontrolled leads us astray into a wilderness of
perplexities and errors, a land of mists and shadows; but which,
properly controlled by experience and reflection, becomes the
noblest attribute of man; the source of poetic genius, the
instrument of discovery in Science."<a href="#_7_" name="f7" id=
"f7"><sup>7</sup></a> His strength and fertility as a discoverer
is to be referred in a great measure to the harmonious blending
of the burning Imagination of the East with the analytical
methods of the West.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
APPOINTED AS A PROFESSOR</p>
<p class="indent">After having completed his education abroad.
Jagadis chose the teaching of Science as his vocation. He was
appointed as Professor of Physical Science at the Presidency
College, Calcutta. He joined the service on the 7th January,
1885. Although he was appointed in Class IV of the <i>then</i>
Bengal Educational Service, (which afterwards merged in the
present Indian Educational Service), he was not admitted to the
full scale of pay of the Service. He, being an Indian, was
allowed to draw only two-thirds the pay of his grade. This
humiliating distinction was, however, removed in <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_007" id="Page_007">[Pg_007]</a></span>his
case, on the 21st September 1903, when the bureaucracy could not
any longer ignore the pressure of enlightened opinion that was
brought to bear on it.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
HIS RESEARCHES ON ELECTRIC WAVES</p>
<p class="indent">It was in 1887, some times after Professor J.
C. Bose had joined the Presidency College, Hertz demonstrated, by
direct experiment, the existence of Electric Waves&mdash;the
properties of which had been predicted by Clerk Maxwell long
before. This great discovery sent a reverberation through the
gallery of the scientific world. And, at once, the scientists in
all countries began to devote their best energies to explorations
in this new Realm of Nature. Young J. C. Bose&mdash;who had drunk
deep at the springs of Scientific Knowledge and whose imagination
had been very deeply touched by the scientific activities of the
West and who had in him the burning desire that India should
'enter the world movement for that advancement of
knowledge'&mdash;also followed suit.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
DIFFICULTIES OF RESEARCHES</p>
<p class="indent">When, however, Prof. J. C. Bose joined the
Presidency College, there was no laboratory worth the name there,
nor had he any of 'those mechanical facilities at his disposal
which every prominent European and American experimental
scientist <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_008" id=
"Page_008">[Pg_008]</a></span>commands'. He had to work under
discouraging difficulties before he could begin his
investigations. He was, however, not a man to quarrel with
circumstances. He bravely accepted them and began to work in his
own private laboratory and with appliances which, in any other
country, would be deemed inadequate. He applied himself closely
to the investigation of the invisible etheric waves and, with the
simple means at his command, accomplished things, which few were
able to perform in spite of their great wealth of external
appliances.</p>
<p class="indent">As the wave-length of a Hertzian (electric) ray
was very large&mdash;about 3 metres<a href="#_8_" name="f8" id=
"f8"><sup>8</sup></a> long&mdash;compared with that of visible
light, considerable difficulties were experienced in carrying on
experiments with the same. It was thought, for instance, that
very large crystals, much larger than what occur in nature, would
be required to show the polarisation of electric ray. Prof. Bose
who 'combined in him the inventiveness of a resourceful engineer,
with the penetration and imagination of a great
scientist'&mdash;designed an instrument which generated very
short electric waves with a length of about 6 millimetres or so.
And, by working with Electric radiations having very short
wave-lengths, he succeeded in demonstrating that the electric
waves are polarised by the crystal <i>Nemalite</i> (which he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_009" id=
"Page_009">[Pg_009]</a></span>himself discovered) in the very
same way as a beam of light is polarised by the crystal
Tourmaline. He then showed that a large number of substances,
which are opaque to Light (<i>e.g.</i> pitch, coal-tar etc.) are
transparent to Electric Waves. He next determined the Index of
Refraction of various substances for invisible Electric Radiation
and thereby eliminated a great difficulty which had presented
itself in Maxwell's theory as to the relation between the index
of refraction of light and the di-electric constant of
insulators. He then determined the wave length of Electric
Radiation as produced by various oscillators.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
HIS EARLY CONTRIBUTIONS AND THEIR APPRECIATIONS</p>
<p class="indent">His first contribution was 'On Polarisation of
Electric Rays by Double Refracting Crystals.' It was read at a
meeting of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, held on the 1st May
1895, and was published in the Journal of the Society in Vol.
LXIV, Part II, page 291. His next contributions were 'On a new
Electro polariscope' and 'On the Double Refraction of the
Electric Ray by a Strained Di-electric.' They appeared, in the
<i>Electrician</i>, the leading journal on Electricity, published
in London. These 'strikingly original researches' won the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_010" id=
"Page_010">[Pg_010]</a></span>attention of the scientific world.
Lord Kelvin, the greatest physicist of the age, declared himself
'literally filled with wonder and admiration for so much success
in the novel and difficult problem which he had attacked.' Lord
Rayleigh communicated the results of his remarkable researches to
the Royal Society. And the Royal Society showed its appreciation
of the high scientific value of his investigation, not only, by
the publication, with high tributes, of a paper of his 'On the
Determination of the Indices of Electric Refraction,' in December
1896, and another paper on the 'Determination of the Wave-length
of Electric Radiation,' in June 1896, but also, by the offer, of
their own accord, of an appropriation from the Special
Parliamentary Grant made to the Society for the Advancement of
Knowledge, for continuation of his work.</p>
<p class="indent">In recognition of the importance of the
contribution made by Prof. Bose, the University of London
conferred on him the Degree of Doctor of Science and the
Cambridge University, the degree of M.A., in 1896. And, to crown
all, the Royal Institution of Great Britain&mdash;rendered famous
by the labour of Davy and Faraday, of Rayleigh and
Dewar&mdash;honoured him by inviting to deliver a 'Friday Evening
Discourse' on his original work. It would not be out of place to
observe that the rare privilege of being invited to deliver a
'Friday Evening <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_011" id=
"Page_011">[Pg_011]</a></span>Discourse' is regarded as one of
the highest distinction that can be conferred on a scientific
man.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
HIS FIRST SCIENTIFIC DEPUTATION. (1896-97)</p>
<p class="indent">The Government of India showed its appreciation
of his work by deputing him to Europe to place the results of his
investigations before the learned Scientific Bodies. He remained
on his Deputation from the 22nd July 1896 to the 19th April 1897.
He read a paper 'On a complete Apparatus for studying the
Properties of Electric Waves' at the meeting of British
Association, held at Liverpool, in 1896. He then communicated a
paper 'On the Selective Conductivity exhibited by Polarising
Substances,' which was published by the Royal Society, in January
1897. He next delivered his 'Friday Evening Discourse,' at the
Royal Institution, 'On Electric Waves,' on the 29th January 1897.
"There is, however, to our thinking" wrote the <i>Spectator</i>
at the time "something of rare interest in the spectacle
presented of a Bengalee of the purest descent possible, lecturing
in London to an audience of appreciative European savants upon
one of the most recondite branches of the modern physical
science." He was then invited to address the Scientific Societies
in Paris. "Prof. J. C. Bose" wrote the Review Encyclopedique,
Paris "exhibited on the 9th of March before the Sorbonne,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_012" id=
"Page_012">[Pg_012]</a></span>an apparatus of his invention for
demonstrating the laws of reflection, refraction, and
polarisation of electric waves. He repeated his experiments on
the 22nd, before a large number of members of the Academie des
Sciences, among whom were Poincare, Cornu, Mascart, Lipmann,
Cailletet, Becquerel and others. These savants highly applauded
the investigations of the Indian Professor." M. Cornu, President
of the Academy of Science, was pleased to address Professor Bose
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="indent">"By your discoveries you have greatly furthered
the cause of Science. You must try to revive the grand traditions
of your race which bore aloft the torch light of art and science
and was the leader of civilization two thousand years ago. We, in
France applaud you." This fervent appeal, we shall see, as we
proceed, did not go in vain.</p>
<p class="indent">He was next invited to lecture before the
Universities in Germany. At Berlin, before the leading physicists
of Germany, he gave an address on Electric Radiation, which was
subsequently published in the <i>Physikaliscen Gesellschaft
Berlin</i>, in April 1897.</p>

FURTHER RESEARCHES ON ELECTRIC WAVES</p>
<p class="indent">Having received the most generous and wide
appreciation of his work, Dr. J. C. Bose continued, with
redoubled vigour, his valuable researches on Electric Waves. He
studied the influence of thickness <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_013" id="Page_013">[Pg_013]</a></span>of air-space on total
reflection of Electric Radiation and showed that the critical
thickness of air-space is determined by the refracting power of
the prism and by the wave-length of the electric oscillations. He
next demonstrated the rotation of the plane of polarisation of
Electric Waves by means of pieces of twisted jute rope. He showed
that, if the pieces are arranged so that their twists are all in
one direction and placed in the path of radiation, they rotate
the plane of polarisation in a direction depending upon the
direction of twists; but, if they are mixed so that there are as
many twisted in one direction as the other, there is no
rotation.<a href="#_9_" name="f9" id="f9"><sup>9</sup></a> He
communicated to the Royal Society the results of his new
researches. And the Royal Society published, in November 1897,
his papers 'On the Determination of the Index of Refraction of
glass for the Electric Ray' and 'On the influence of Thickness of
Air-space on Total Reflection of Electric Radiation' and, in
March 1898, his further contributions 'On the Rotation of Plane
of Polarisation of Electric Waves by a twisted structure' and 'On
the Production of a "Dark cross" in the Field of Electro-magnetic
Radiation.'</p>

SELF-RECOVERING "COHERER"</p>
<p class="indent">The study of Electric Waves by Dr. J. C. Bose
led <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_014" id=
"Page_014">[Pg_014]</a></span>not only to the devising of methods
for the production of the shortest Electric Waves known but also
to the construction of a very delicate 'Receiver' for the
detection of invisible other disturbances. The most sensitive
form of detector hitherto known was the "Coherer." One of the
forms made by Sir Oliver Lodge consisted simply of a glass tube
containing iron turnings, in contact with which were wire led
into opposite ends of the tube. The arrangement was placed in
series with a galvanometer and a battery; when the turnings were
struck by electric waves, the resistance between loose metallic
contacts was diminished and the deflection of the galvanometer
was increased. Thus the deflection of the galvanometer was made
to indicate the arrival of electric waves. The arrangement was,
no doubt, a sensitive one, but, to get a greater delicacy, Dr.
Bose used, instead of iron turnings, spiral springs which were
pushed against each other by means of a screw.<a href="#_10_"
name="f10" id="f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Still the arrangement
laboured under one great disadvantage. The 'receiver' had to be
tapped between each experiment. So something better than a
'cohering' receiving was needed&mdash;something that was
self-recovering, like a human eye. To discover that something,
Dr. Bose began a study of the whole theory of 'coherer action.'
It was hitherto believed <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_015"
id="Page_015">[Pg_015]</a></span>that the electric waves, by
impinging on iron and other metallic particles in contact,
brought about a sort of fusion&mdash;a sort of
'coherence'&mdash;and that the diminution of resistance was the
result of that 'coherence.' To satisfy himself as to the
correctness of this theory, Dr. Bose engaged himself in a most
laborious investigation to find out the action of electric
radiation not only on iron particles but on all kinds of matter
and ultimately discovered the surprising fact that, though the
impact of electric waves generally produced a diminution of
resistance, with <i>potassium</i> there was an <i>increase</i> of
resistance after the waves had ceased.<a href="#_11_" name="f11"
id="f11"><sup>11</sup></a> This discovery at once showed the
untenability of the old theory and pointed to the conclusion that
the effect of electric radiation on matter is one of
discriminative molecular action&mdash;that the Electric Waves
produced a re-arrangement of the molecules which may either
increase or decrease the contact resistance. It may be
incidentally mentioned here that this detection of molecular
change in matter under electric stimulation has given rise to a
new theory of photographic action.</p>
<p class="indent">As a result of his painstaking investigation on
the action of Electric Waves on different kinds of matter, Dr.
Bose invented a new type of self-recovering electric receiver,
"so perfect in its action <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_016" id="Page_016">[Pg_016]</a></span>that the Electrician
suggested its use in ships and in electro-magnetic light-houses
for the communication and transmission of danger-signals at sea
through space. This was, in 1895, several years in advance of the
present wireless system." Practical application of the results of
Dr. Bose's investigations appeared so important that the
Governments of Great Britain and the United States of America
granted him patents for his invention of a certain crystal
receiver which proved to be the most sensitive detector of the
wireless signal. Dr. Bose, however, has made no secret at any
time as to the construction of his apparatus. He has never
utilised the patents granted to him for personal gain. His
inventions are "open to all the world to adopt for practical and
money-making purposes." "The spirit of our national culture"
observes Sir J. C. Bose "demands that we should for ever be free
from the desecration of utilising knowledge for personal
gain."<a href="#_12_" name="f12" id="f12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

HIS RESEARCHES TAKE A NEW TURN</p>
<p class="indent">This inquiry which Dr. J. C. Bose started for
the purpose of ascertaining 'coherer action'&mdash;why the
"receiver" had to be tapped in order to respond again to electric
waves&mdash;took him <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_017" id=
"Page_017">[Pg_017]</a></span>unconsciously to the border region
of physics and physiology and gave an altogether new turn to his
researches. "He found that the uncertainty of the early type of
his receiver was brought on by 'fatigue' and that the curve of
fatigue of his instrument closely resembled the fatigue curve of
animal muscle."<a href="#_13_" name="f13" id=
"f13"><sup>13</sup></a> He did not stop there but pushed on his
investigations and found "that the 'tiredness' of his instrument
was removed by suitable stimulants and that application of
certain poisons, on the other hand, permanently abolished its
sensitiveness." He was amazed at this discovery&mdash;this
parallelism in the behaviour of the 'receiver' to the living
muscle. This led him to a systematic study of all matter, Organic
and Inorganic, Living and Non-Living.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
RESPONSE IN LIVING AND NON-LIVING</p>
<p class="indent">He began an examination of inorganic matter in
the same way as a biologist examines a muscle or a nerve. He
subjected metals to various kinds of stimulus&mdash;mechanical,
thermal, chemical, and electrical. He found that all sorts of
stimulus produce an excitatory change in them. And this
excitation sometimes expresses itself in a visible change
of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_018" id=
"Page_018">[Pg_018]</a></span> form and sometimes not; but the
disturbance produced by the stimulus always exhibits itself in an
<i>electric response</i>. He next subjected plants and animal
tissues to various kinds of stimulus and also found that they
also give an <i>electric response</i>. Finding that a universal
reaction brought together metals, plants and animals under a
common law, he next proceeded to a study of <i>modifications in
response</i>, which occur under various conditions. He found that
they are all benumbed by cold, intoxicated by alcohol, wearied by
excessive work, stupified by anaesthetics, excited by electric
currents, stung by physical blows and killed by poison&mdash;they
all exhibit essentially the same phenomena of fatigue and
depression, together with possibilities of recovery and of
exaltation, yet also that of permanent irresponsiveness which is
associated with death&mdash;they all are responsive or
irresponsive under the same conditions and in the same manner.
The investigations showed that, in the entire range of
response phenomena (inclusive as that is of metals, plants and
animals) there is no breach of continuity; that "the living
response in all its diverse modifications is only a repetition of
responses seen in the inorganic" and that the phenomena of
response "are determined, not by the play of an unknowable and
arbitrary <i>vital force</i>, but by the working of laws that
know no change, acting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_019"

SECOND SCIENTIFIC DEPUTATION, 1900-01</p>
<p class="indent">In the year 1900, the International Scientific
Congress was held, in Paris. And Dr. J. C. Bose was deputed by
the Government of India to the Congress as a delegate from this
country. Before the assembled scientists, Dr. Bose delivered a
remarkable address on the results of his researches on the
similarity of Response of Inorganic and Living Substances to
Electric stimulus ... 'De la g&ecirc;n&ecirc;ralit&ecirc; de
Ph&ecirc;nom&ecirc;nes Moleculairs produits par l'Ectricit&eacute; sur la
matiri&ecirc; Inorganique et sur la mati&ecirc;re Vivante.' He
next read a paper 'On the Similarity of effect of Electric
Stimulus on Inorganic and Living Substances' before the Bradford
meeting of the British Association in 1900. He then contributed a
very interesting paper 'on Binocular Alteration of Vision,' which
was published by the Physiological Society of London, in November
1900. It may be mentioned here, by the way, that, in course of
his investigations on the Response of the Living and Non-Living
substances, Dr. Bose constructed an "artificial retina" to study
the characteristics of the excitatory change produced by a
stimulus on <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_020" id=
"Page_020">[Pg_020]</a></span>the retina and these
characteristics gave him a clue to the unexpected discovery of

supplements its fellow by turns, instead of acting as a

Royal Society his researches 'On the Continuity of Effect of
Light and Electric Radiation on Matter,' and 'On the Similarities
between Mechanical and Radiation Strains,' and 'On the Strain

1901. Then, on the 10th May 1901, he delivered his remarkable
'Friday Evening Discourse,' at the Royal Institution, on the
'Response of Inorganic Matter to Stimulus.'</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
OPPOSITION OF THE PHYSIOLOGISTS</p>
<p class="indent">Then, on the 5th June 1901, he gave an
experimental demonstration, before the Royal Society, on the
subject of his researches 'On Electric Response of Inorganic
Substances' which had already been communicated to that Society,
on the 7th May 1901. He was strongly assailed by Sir John Burden
Sanderson, the leading physiologist, and some of his followers.
They objected to a physicist straying into the preserve
especially reserved for <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_021"
id="Page_021">[Pg_021]</a></span>them. They dogmatically asserted
<i>as physiologists</i> that the excitatory response of ordinary
plants to mechanical stimulus was an impossibility. But they
failed to urge anything against the experiment of the physicist.
In consequence of this opposition, Dr. Bose's paper, which was
already in print, was not published but was placed in the
archives of the Royal Society. "And it happened that eight months
after the reading of his Paper, another communication found
publication in the Journal of a different Society which was
practically the same as Dr. Bose's but without any
acknowledgment. The author of this communication was a gentleman
who had previously opposed him at the Royal Society. The
plagiarism was subsequently discovered and led to much
unpleasantness. It is not necessary to refer any more to this
subject except as an explanation of the fact that the determined
hostility and misrepresentation of one man succeeded for more
than 10 years to bar all avenues of publications for his
discoveries."<a href="#_16_" name="f16" id=
"f16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">The opposition of the physiologists, however,
did one good. It spurred Dr. Bose on and made him stronger in his
determination not to encompass himself, within the narrow groove
of physical investigation. He took furlough for one year, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_022" id=
"Page_022">[Pg_022]</a></span>extension of the period of his
Deputation, and applied himself vigorously to the investigations,
which he had already commenced in India and received facilities
from the Managers of the Royal Institution to work in the
Davy-Faraday Laboratory. He next read, at the Glasgow meeting of
the British Association, in 1901, a paper 'On the Conductivity of
Metallic particles under Cyclic Electro-magnetic
Variation.' Then, in March 1902, "Prof. Bose" says the
<i>Nature</i> "performed a series of experiments before the
Linnean Society showing electric response for certain portions of
the plant organism, which proved that as concerning fatigue,
behaviour at high and low temperatures, the effects produced by
poisons and anaesthetics, the responses are identical with those
held to be characteristic of muscle and nerve." The Linnean
Society published, in its Journal, in March 1902, his paper 'On
Electric Response of Ordinary Plants under Mechanical Stimulus.'
He then communicated to the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de Physique, Paris, his paper 'Sur la R&eacute;sponse
Electrique dans les M&eacute;taux, les Tissu Animaux et V&eacute;g&eacute;taux.' The Royal Society
published, in April 1902, his contribution 'On the Electromotive Wave accompanying Mechanical
Disturbance in Metals in contact with Electrolyte.' He was next
asked by the Royal Photographic Society to give a <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_023" id=
"Page_023">[Pg_023]</a></span>discourse 'On the Strain Theory
Vision and of Photographic Action,' which was published by the
Society, in its Journal, in June 1902. He then wrote a paper 'On
the Electric Response in Animal, Vegetable and Metal,' which was
read before the Belfast meeting of the British Association, in
1902. The President of the Botanical Section at Belfast, in his
address, observed "Some very striking results were published by
Bose on Electric Response in ordinary plants. Bose's
investigations established a very close similarity in behaviour
between the vegetable and the animal. Summation effects were
observed and fatigue effect demonstrated, while it was definitely
shown that the responses were physiological. They ceased as soon
as the piece of tissue was killed by heating. These observations
strengthen considerably the view of the identical nature of the
animal and vegetable protoplasm."</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. Bose then brought out a systematic treatise
embodying the results of his researches under the significant
title of 'Response in the Living and Non-living.' He returned to
India, in October, 1902.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
GOVERNMENT RECOGNITION</p>
<p class="indent">After he had come back, from the Second
Scientific Deputation, the Government of India conferred on him
the distinction of Companion of the Order of <span class=

Indian Empire, in 1903, in recognition of his valuable
researches.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
PLANT LIFE AND ANIMAL LIFE</p>
<p class="indent">Next Dr. Bose, in natural sequence to the
investigation of the response in 'inorganic' matter commenced 'a
prolonged study of the activities of plant life as compared with
corresponding functioning of animal life.'</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
ALL PLANTS ARE "SENSITIVE"</p>
<p class="indent">It was believed that so-called 'sensitive'
plants alone exhibited excitation by <i>electric response</i>.
But Dr. Bose, believing in continuity of responsive phenomena,
used the same experimental devices, with which he had already
succeeded in obtaining the <i>electric response</i> of inorganic
substances, to test whether ordinary plants also&mdash;meaning
those usually regarded as 'insensitive'&mdash;would or would not
exhibit excitatory <i>electrical response</i> to stimulus. With
the help of very delicate instruments, Dr. Bose demonstrated the
very startling fact that not only every plant, but every organ of
every plant gave true <i>excitatory electric
response</i>&mdash;and that response was not confined alone to
'sensitive' plants like <i>Mimosa</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. Bose then proceeded to investigate whether
the responsive effects which he had shown to occur <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_025" id="Page_025">[Pg_025]</a></span>in
ordinary plants might not be further exhibited by means of
<i>visible mechanical response</i>, thus fully removing the
distinction commonly assumed to exist between the 'sensitive' and
supposed 'non-sensitive.' Dr. Bose invented 'special apparatus of
extreme delicacy,' which detected infinitesimal tremors, and showed that ordinary plants, usually
regarded as insensitive, gave <i>motile responses</i>, which had
hitherto passed unnoticed. His later investigation shows that
"all plants, even the trees, are fully alive to changes of
environment; they respond visibly to all stimuli, even to the
slight fluctuations of light by a drifting cloud."<a href="#_17_"
name="f17" id="f17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
'TROPIC' MOVEMENTS</p>
<p class="indent">Finding that the plants give, not only
<i>electric</i> but <i>motile</i> response as well, to stimulus,
Dr. Bose proceeded to study the nature of responses evoked in
plants by the <i>stimuli of the natural forces</i>. He found that
plants respond visibly, by movements, to <i>environmental
stimuli</i>. But the movements induced&mdash;'tropic'
movements&mdash;are extremely diverse. Light, for example,
induces sometimes positive curvature, sometimes negative.
Gravitation, again, induces one movement in the root, and the
opposition in the shoot. Dr. Bose applied himself to find out
whether <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_026" id=
"Page_026">[Pg_026]</a></span>the movements in response to
external stimuli, though apparently so diverse, could not be
ultimately reduced to a fundamental unity of reaction. As a
result of a very deep and penetrating study of the effects of
various environmental stimuli, on different plant organs, he
showed that the cells on two sides are unequally influenced, on
account of different external conditions, and contract unequally,
and hence the various movements are produced&mdash;that the many
anomalous effects, hitherto ascribed to
'specific sensibilities,' are due to the 'differential
sensibilities'&mdash;differential excitability of anisotropic
structures and to the opposite effects of external and internal
stimuli&mdash;that all varieties of plant movements are capable
of a consistent mechanical explanation. Dr. Bose's "latest
investigations recently communicated to the Royal Society have
established the single fundamental reaction which underlies all
these effects so extremely diverse."<a href="#_18_" name="f18"
id="f18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
EXTENDED APPLICATION OF MECHANICAL THEORY</p>
<p class="indent">With an extended application of his mechanical
theory, Dr. Bose has gradually removed the veil of obscurity from
many a phenomenon in plant life. <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_027" id="Page_027">[Pg_027]</a></span>The 'autonomous'
movements of plants, for example, which remained enveloped in
mystery, received a satisfactory solution at his hands.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
'AUTONOMOUS' MOVEMENTS</p>
<p class="indent">It was believed that automatically pulsating
tissues draw their energy from a mysterious "vital force" working
within. By controlling external forces, Dr. Bose stopped the
pulsation and re-started it and thus demonstrated that the
'automatic action' was not due to any internal vital force. He
pointed out that the external stimulus&mdash;instead of causing,
as was customary to suppose, an explosive chemical change and an
inevitable run-down of energy&mdash;brings about an accumulation
of energy by the plant. And with the accumulation of absorbed
energy, a point is reached when there is an overflow&mdash;the
excess of energy bubbles over, as it were, and shows itself in
'spontaneous' movements. The stimulus being strong a single
response&mdash;a single twitching of the leaflets&mdash;is not
enough to express the whole of the leaf's responsive energy and
it yields a multiple response&mdash;it reverberates&mdash;it
manifests itself in 'automatic' pulsations. When, however, the
accumulated energy is exhausted, then there is also an end of
'spontaneous movements.' There are strictly speaking, no
'spontaneous' movements; those known by that name are really due
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_028" id=
"Page_028">[Pg_028]</a></span>either to the immediate effects of
external stimulus or to the stimulus previously absorbed and held
latent in the plant to find subsequent expression&mdash;due to
the direct or indirect action of external forces which are
transformed in the machinery of the plants in obedience to the
principle of the Conservation of Energy.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
"ASCENT OF SAP" "AND GROWTH"</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. Bose then showed that, not gross mechanical
movements alone, but also other invisible movements are initiated
by the action of stimulus, and that the various activities, such
as the "ascent of sap" and "growth" are in reality different
reactions to the stimulating action of energy supplied by the
environment. In this way, Dr. Bose showed that several obscure
phenomena, in the life-processes of the plant, can be very
satisfactorily explained by the Mechanical Theory.</p>
<p class="indent">It would not be out of place to mention that
Dr. Bose, to carry on his researches on the Ascent of Sap,
invented a new type of instrument (Shoshungraph). And for an
accurate investigation on the phenomenon of growth of plants he
devised an instrument (Growth Recorder) for instantaneous
measurement of the rate of growth and another instrument
(Balanced Crescograph) for determining the influences of various
agencies on growth. So <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_029"
id="Page_029">[Pg_029]</a></span>very marvellous these
instruments that the growth, which takes place, during a few
beats of pendulum, is measured, and, in less than a quarter of an
hour, the action of fertilizers, foods, electrical currents and
various stimulants are determined. "What is the tale of Aladdin
and his wonderful lamp" exclaims the Editor of the
<i>Scientific American</i> "compared with the true story told by
the crescograph?... Instead of waiting a whole season, perhaps
years, to discover whether or not it is wise to mix this or that
fertilizer with the soil one can now find in a few minutes!" Yet
these are the instruments which are better known in Washington
than in Calcutta! The question of their application to practical
agriculture has excited more interest in the United States of
America than in this unfortunate land, which is an essentially
agricultural country!</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
FUNDAMENTAL IDENTITY OF REACTIONS</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. Bose showed that there is no physiological
response given by the most highly organised animal tissue that is
not also to be met with in the plant. He carried on "Researches
on Diurnal Sleep" and showed that the plant is not equally
sensitive to an external stimulus during day and night, and that
there is a fundamental identity of life-reaction in plant and
animal, as seen in a similar periodic <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_030" id=
"Page_030">[Pg_030]</a></span>insensibility in both,
corresponding to what we call <i>sleep</i>. He also showed that
the passage of life in the plant, as in the animal, is marked by
an unmistakable spasm. He invented, an instrument (Morograph)
with which he recorded the critical point of death of a plant
with great exactness. He demonstrated, in the most conclusive
manner, that there is an essential unity of physiological effects
of drugs on plant and animal tissues and showed the modifications
which are introduced into these effects by the factor of
individual 'constitution.' It may be mentioned casually that
"this physiological identity in the effect of drugs is regarded
by leading physicians as of great significance in the scientific
advance of Medicine; since we have a means of testing the effect
of drugs under conditions far simpler than those presented by the
patient, far subtler too, as well as more humane than those of
experiments on animals."<a href="#_19_" name="f19" id=
"f19"><sup>19</sup></a> Dr. Bose further demonstrated that there
is conduction of the excitatory impulse in the plant, like the
nervous impulse in the animal; and showed the possibility of
detecting the wave in transit and measured the speed with which
the excitation coursed through the plant and also showed that the
velocity of excitation is modified, by different agencies, even
in the case <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_031" id=
"Page_031">[Pg_031]</a></span>of ordinary plants. He also showed
that the polar effects induced by electric currents, both in
plants and animals, are identical.</p>
<p class="indent">These remarkable researches on Plant Response
have 'revolutionised in some respects and very much extended in
others our knowledge of the response of plants to stimulus.'</p>

FURTHER DIFFICULTIES</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. Bose communicated his paper 'On the
Electric Pulsation accompanying Automatic Movements in Desmodium
Gyrans' to the Linnaean Society, which
was published, in December 1902. Then, in 1903, he communicated
to the Royal Society his researches on 'Investigation on
Mechanical Response in Plants,' 'On Polar effects of Currents on
the Stimulation of Plants,' 'On the Velocity of Transmission of
Excitatory waves in Plants,' 'On the excitability and
conductivity of Plant Tissues,' 'On the Propagation of the
Electromotive Wave concomitant of Excitatory Waves in Plants,'
'On Multiple Response in Plants,' 'On an enquiry into the cause

<p class="indent">"These new contributions" made by Dr. Bose on
Plant Response "were regarded as of such great importance that
the Royal Society showed its special appreciation by recommending
them to be <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_032" id=
"Page_032">[Pg_032]</a></span>published in their Philosophical
Transactions. But the same influence, which had hitherto stood in
his way, triumphed once more, and it was at the very last moment
that the publication was withheld. The Royal Society, however,
informed him that his results were of fundamental importance, but
as they were so wholly unexpected and so opposed to the existing
theories, that they would reserve their judgment until, at some
future time, plants themselves could be made to record their
answers to questions put to them. This was interpreted in certain
quarters here as the final rejection of Dr. Bose's theories by

ADOPTS A NEW METHOD OF INVESTIGATION</p>
<p class="indent">Hitherto Dr. Bose detected the various
excitatory effects of plants by means of <i>mechanical
response</i>. Being now confronted with opposition, he turned his
attention to the finding of corroboration of the various results,
which he had already obtained, by some other method of
investigation. And for this he employed the method of <i>electric
response</i>. He found that the results obtained by this new
method of inquiry corroborated those already obtained by him by
the old method. Emboldened by this corroboration, he next
proceeded to extend this new method of inquiry by means of
<i>electric response</i> into the field of Animal Physiology with
a view to explain responsive phenomena in general on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_034" id=

molecular reaction which occurs even in inorganic
matter.'<a href="#_21_" name="f21" id="f21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
RESULT OF THE INVESTIGATION</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. Bose found, in the plant as well as in the
animal, "a similar series of excitatory effects, whether these be
exhibited mechanically or electrically. Both alike are
responsive, and similarly responsive, to all the diverse forms of
stimulus that impinge upon them. We ascend, in the one case as in
the other, from the simplicities of the isotropic to the
complexities of the anisotropic; and the laws of these isotropic
and anisotropic responses are the same in both. The responsive
peculiarities of epidermis, epithelium, and gland; the response
of the digestive organ, with its phasic alterations; and the
excitatory electrical discharge of an anisotropic plate, are the
same in the plant as in the animal. The plant, like the animal,
is a single organic whole, all its different parts being
connected, and their activities co-ordinated, by the agency of
those conducting strands which are known as nerves. As in the
plant nerve, moreover, so also in the animal, stimulation gives
rise to two distinct impulses, exhibiting themselves by two-fold
mechanical and electrical indications of <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_035" id=
"Page_035">[Pg_035]</a></span>opposite signs.... The dual
qualities or tones known to us in sensation, further, are
correspondent with those two different nervous impulses, of
opposite signs, which are occasioned by stimulation. These two
sensory responses&mdash;positive and negative, pleasure and
pain&mdash;are found to be subject to the same modifications,
under parallel conditions, as the positive and negative
mechanical and electrical indications with which they are
associated. And finally, perhaps, the most significant example
for the effect of induced anisotropy lies in that differential
impression made by stimulus on the sensory surfaces, which
remains latent, and capable of revival, as the memory-image. In
this demonstration of continuity, then, it has been found that
the dividing frontiers between Physics, Physiology, and
Psychology have disappeared."<a href="#_22_" name="f22" id=

<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
CLASH WITH CURRENT VIEWS</p>
<p class="indent">The results, which Dr. Bose obtained from
actual experiments, clashed, however, with the theories in vogue.
The reactions of different issues were hitherto regarded as
<i>special differences</i>. As against this, a <i>continuity</i>
is shown to exist between them. Thus, nerve was universally
regarded as <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_036" id=
"Page_036">[Pg_036]</a></span>typically <i>non-motile</i>; its
responses were believed to be characteristically different from
those of muscle. Dr. Bose, however, has shown that nerve is
indisputably motile and that the characteristic variations in the
response of nerve are, generally speaking, similar to those of
the muscle.</p>
<p class="indent">It was customary to regard plants as devoid of
the power to conduct true excitation. Dr. Bose had already shown
that this view was incorrect. He now showed, by experiment, that
the response of the <i>isolated</i> vegetal nerve is
indistinguishable from that of animal nerve, throughout a large
series of parallel variations of condition. So complete, indeed,
is the similarity between the responses of plant and animal,
found, of which this is one instance, that the discovery of a
given responsive characteristic in one case proves a sure guide
to its observation in the other, and the explanation of
phenomenon, under the simpler conditions of the plant, is found
fully sufficient for its elucidation under the more complex
circumstances of the animal. Dr. Bose found 'differential
excitability' is widely present as a factor in determining the
character of special responses and showed that many anomalous
conclusions, with regard to the response of certain animal
tissues, had arisen from the failure to take account of the
'differential excitability' of anisotropic organs. Hitherto
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_037" id=
"Page_037">[Pg_037]</a></span>Pfluger's Law of the polar effects
of currents was supposed to rest on secure foundations. But Dr.
Bose showed that Pfluger's Law was not of such universal
application as was supposed. He demonstrated that, above and
below a certain range of electromotive intensity, the polar
effects of currents are precisely opposite to those enunciated by
Pfluger.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
SENSATION</p>
<p class="indent">It was supposed that nervous impulse, which,
must necessarily form the basis of sensation, was beyond any
conceivable power of visual scrutiny. But Dr. Bose showed that
this impulse is actually attended by change of form, and is,
therefore capable of direct observation. He also showed that the
disturbance, instead of being single, is of two different
kinds&mdash;<i>viz.</i>, one of expansion (positive) and the
other of contraction (negative)&mdash;and that, when the stimulus
is feeble, the positive is transmitted, and, when the stimulus is
stronger, both positive and negative are transmitted, but the
negative, however, being more intense, masks the positive. He
identified the wave of expansion travelling along the nerve with
the tendency to pleasure, and the wave of contraction, with the
tendency to pain. It thus appears that all pain contains an
element of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_038" id=
"Page_038">[Pg_038]</a></span>pleasure, and that pleasure, if
carried too far becomes pain&mdash;that "the tone of our
sensation is determined by the intensity of nervous excitation
that reaches the central perceiving organ."</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
MEMORY IMAGE AND ITS REVIVAL</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. Bose next pointed out that there remains,
for every response, a certain residual effect. A substance, which
has responded to a given stimulus, retains, as an after-effect, a
'latent impression' of that stimulus and this 'latent impression'
is capable of subsequent revival by bringing about the original
condition of excitation. The impress made by the action of
stimulus, though it remains latent and invisible, can be revived
by the impact of a fresh excitatory impulse.</p>
<p class="indent">Experimenting with a metallic <i>leaf</i>, Dr.
Bose demonstrated the revival of a latent impression under the
action of diffused stimulus. The investigation by Dr. Bose on the
after-effects of stimulus has thrown some light on the obscure
phenomenon, of 'memory.' It appears that, when there is a mental
revival of past experience, the diffuse impulse of the 'will'
acts on the sensory surface, which contains the latent impression
and re-awakens the image which appears to have faded out. Memory
is concerned, thus, with the after-effect of an impression
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_039" id=
"Page_039">[Pg_039]</a></span>induced by a stimulus. It differs
from ordinary sensation in the fact that the stimulus which
evokes the response, instead of being external and objective, is
merely psychic and subjective.</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. Bose has, by experimental devises, shown
the possibility of tracing 'memory-impression' backwards even in
inorganic matter, such latent impression being capable of
subsequent revival. An investigation of the after-effects of
stimulus, on living tissues would open out the great problem of
the influence of past events on our present condition.</p>

DEATH-STRUGGLE AND MEMORY REVIVAL</p>
<p class="indent">There is a wide-spread belief that, in the case
of a sudden death-struggle, as for example, when drowning, the
memory, of the past comes in a flash. "Assuming the correctness
of this," says Sir Jagadis "certain experimental results which I
have obtained may be pertinent to the subject. The experiment
consisted in finding whether the plant, near the point of death,
gave any signal of the approaching crisis. I found that at this
critical moment a sudden electrical spasm sweeps through every
part of the organism. Such a strong and diffused
stimulation&mdash;now involuntary&mdash;may be expected in a
human subject to crowd into one <span class='pagenum'><a name=

"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
FURTHER EXPERIMENTAL EXPLORATION</p>
<p class="indent">By his new and newer methods of investigation,
Dr. Bose got a deep and deeper perception of that underlying
unity, for the demonstration of which he had been labouring since
1901. But the dream of his life was not yet realised. No direct
method of obtaining response record was yet obtained. Hitherto
the response recorder employed was a modification of the optical
lever, automatic records being secured by the very inconvenient
and tedious process of photography (which again introduced
complications by subjecting a plant to darkness and <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_042" id=
"Page_042">[Pg_042]</a></span>thereby modifying its normal
excitability); and the plant was not automatically excited by
stimulus, besides the results obtained were liable to be
influenced by personal factor. So Dr. Bose set about the
invention of an apparatus, which should discard the use of
photography and in which the plant (attached to the recording
apparatus) should be automatically excited by stimulus absolutely
constant, should make its own responsive record, going through
its own period of recovery, and embarking on the same cycle over
again without assistance at any point on the part of the
observer. Great difficulties were encountered in realising these
ideal requirements. They appeared, at first, to be
insurmountable. But, with continuous toil and persistence, Dr.
Bose succeeded in designing a long battery of supersensitive
instruments and apparatus, which made the seeming impossible
possible. His ingenious "Resonant and Oscillating Recorders" gave
a simple and direct method of obtaining the record. The plant,
being automatically excited by stimulus, made its own
responsive record. The closed doors, at last, opened. The secret
of plant life stood revealed by the autographs of the plant
itself. The great <i>sadhana</i> of his life now received its
fulfilment. "It has been beautifully said&mdash;and it is a law
of the moral world as unchangeable as physical laws&mdash;'Ask,
and it shall be given you; <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_043" id="Page_043">[Pg_043]</a></span>seek, and ye shall

<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
TRANSMISSION OF EXCITATION IN MIMOSA</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. Bose had shown that all plants are
sensitive&mdash;that there is no difference between the so-called
'sensitive' and the supposed 'non-sensitive'&mdash;that they gave
alike the true excitatory <i>electric</i>
<i>response</i> as well as <i>motile response</i>. The evidence
of plant's script now removed beyond any doubt the long-standing
error which divided the vegetable
world into 'sensitive' and 'insensitive.' There remained,
however, the question of nervous impulse in plants, the discovery
of which, though announced by Dr. Bose, ten years ago, did not
yet find full acceptance.</p>
<p class="indent">Finding that the scope of his investigation has
been very much enlarged by the devise of the Resonant Recorder,
Dr. Bose proceeded to attack the <i>current</i> view "that there
was no transmission of true excitation in Mimosa, the propagated
impulse being regarded as merely hydromechanical." This
conclusion was based on the experiments of the leading German
plant physiologists, Pfeffer and <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_044" id="Page_044">[Pg_044]</a></span>Haverlandt who failed
to bring on any variation in the propagated impulse in plants
either by scalding or by application of an anaesthetic. Dr. Bose
pointed out that, as Pfeffer applied the chloroform to the
<i>outer</i> stalk and Haverlandt scalded the <i>outer</i> stem,
neither the stimulant nor the anaesthetic reached the nerves. So
he, instead of applying the stimulant or the anaesthetic, in the
<i>liquid</i> form, to the outer stalk or stem, confined the
Mimosa, in a little chamber, and subjected it to the influence of
the <i>vapour</i> of the drug. The fumes now penetrated and
reached the nerves and the plant was made to record, by its own
script, the variations, if any, produced by the drugs. The plant,
by its self-made records, showed exultation with alcohol,
depression with chloroform, rapid transmission of a shock with
the application of heat, and an abolition of the propagated
impulse with the application of a deadly poison like potassium cyanide. This variation in the
transmitted impulse, under physiological variations, showed that
it was not a physical one. This sealed the fate of the
hydromechanical theory.</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. Bose went further and showed that the
impulse is transmitted in both directions along the nerve but not
at the same rate. And, by interposing an electric block, he
arrested the nervous impulse in a plant in a manner similar to
the corresponding arrest in the animal nerve and thereby
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_045"
id="Page_045">[Pg_045]</a></span>produced nervous
<i>paralysis</i> in plant, such paralysis being afterwards cured
by appropriate treatment. "If he had made no other discovery,"
says the Editor of the <i>Scientific American</i> "Dr. Bose would
have earned an enduring reputation in the annals of science. We
know very little about paralysis in the human body, and
practically nothing about its cause. The nervous system of the
higher animals is so complicated, so intricate, that it is hard
to understand its derangement. The human nerve dies when
isolated. It is killed by the shock of removal, and responds for
the moment abnormally and therefore deceptively. But, if we study
the simplest kind of a nerve,&mdash;and the simplest is that of a
plant,&mdash;we may hope to understand what occurs when a hand or
a foot cannot be made to move. To find out that plants have
nerves, to induce paralysis in such nerves and then to cure
them&mdash;such experiments will lead to discoveries that may
ultimately enable physicians to treat more rationally than they
do, the various forms of paralysis now regarded as
incurable."</p>
<p style=

MIMOSA AND MAN</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. Bose showed not only that the nervous
impulse in plant and in man is exalted or inhibited under
identical conditions but carried the parallelism <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_046" id=
"Page_046">[Pg_046]</a></span>very far and pointed out the
blighting effects on life of a complete seclusion and protection
from the world outside. "A plant carefully protected under glass
from outside shocks", says Sir Jagadis "looks sleek and
flourishing; but its higher nervous function is then found to be
atrophied. But when a succession of blows is rained on this
effete and bloated specimen, the shocks themselves create nervous
channels and arouse anew the deteriorated nature. And is it not
shocks of adversity, and not cotton-wool protection, that evolve
true manhood?"<a href="#_25_" name="f25" id=

of the Society, held on the 6th March 1913. The Royal Society
<i>now</i> found that Dr. Bose had rendered the seemingly

investigations on the Irritability of Plants. By making the plant
tell its own story, by means of its self-made records, he showed
that there is hardly any phenomenon of irritability observed in
the animal which is not also found in the plant and that the
various manifestations of irritability in the plant are identical
with those in the animal and that many difficult problems in
Animal Physiology find their solution in the experimental study
of corresponding problems under simpler conditions of vegetable

PUBLIC <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_049" id=

<p class="indent">Dr. J. C. Bose was invited to give his evidence
before the Royal Commission on the Public Services in India. With
reference to the Method of Recruitment, he observed, in his
written statement, as follows:&mdash;" ... I think that a high
standard of scholarship should be the only qualification insisted
on. Graduates of well-known Universities, distinguished for a
particular line of study, should be given the preference. I think
the prospects of the Indian Educational Service are sufficiently
high to attract the very best material. In Colonial Universities
they manage to get very distinguished men without any
extravagantly high pay.... At present the recruitment in the
Indian Educational Service is made in England and is practically
confined to Englishmen. Such racial preference is, in my opinion,
prejudicial to the interest of education. The best men available,
English or Indian, should be selected impartially, and high
scholarship should be the only test.... It is unfortunate that
Indian graduates of European Universities who had distinguished
themselves in a remarkable manner do not for one reason or other
find facilities for entering the higher Educational Service.... I
should like to add that these highly qualified Indians need only
opportunities to render service which would greatly advance the
cause of higher education.... If <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_050" id="Page_050">[Pg_050]</a></span>promising Indian
graduates are given the opportunity of visiting foreign
Universities, I have no doubt that they would stand comparison
with the best recruits that can be obtained from the West.... As
teachers and workers it is an incontestable fact that Indian
Officers have distinguished themselves very highly, and anything
which discriminates between Europeans and Indians in the way of
pay and prospects is most undesirable. A sense of injustice is
ill-calculated to bring about that harmony which is so necessary
among all the members of an educational institution, professors
and students alike."<a href="#_27_" name="f27" id=
"f27"><sup>27</sup></a> Pressing next for a high level of
scholarship, in the Indian Educational Service, he
wrote:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquot">"It has been said that the present standard
of Indian Universities is not as high as that of British
Universities, and that the work done by the former is more like
that of the 6th form of the public schools in England. It is
therefore urged that what is required for an Educational officer
in the capacity to manage classes rather than high scholarship. I
do not agree with these views. (1) There are Universities in
Great Britain whose standards are not higher than ours; I do not
think <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_051" id=
"Page_051">[Pg_051]</a></span>that the Pass Degree even of Oxford
or Cambridge is higher than the corresponding degree here (2) the
standard of the Indian University is being steadily raised; (3)
the standard will depend upon what the men entrusted with
Educational work will make it. For these reasons it is necessary
that the level of scholarship represented by the Indian
Educational Service should be maintained very high."<a href=
"#_28_" name="f28" id="f28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">He then dwelt on what should be the aim of
Higher Education in India and observed as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquot">"... I think that all the machinery to
improve the higher education in India would be altogether
ineffectual unless India enters the world movement for the
advancement of knowledge. And for this it is absolutely necessary
to touch the imagination of the people so as to rouse them to
give their best energies to the work of research and discovery,
in which all the nations of the world are now engaged. To aim
anything less will only end in lifeless and mechanical system
from which the soul of reality has passed away."<a href="#_28_"
name="f28a" id="f28a"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">He was called, on the 18th December 1913, and
was put to a searching examination by the Members <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_052" id="Page_052">[Pg_052]</a></span>of
the Royal Commission. The evidence that he gave is instinct with
patriotism and is highly remarkable for its simplicity and
directness about the things he said. To the Chairman (Lord
Islington) he stated that he "favoured an arrangement by which
Indians would enter the higher ranks of the service, either
through the Provincial Service or by direct recruitment in India.
The latter class of officers, after completing their education in
India, should ordinarily go to Europe with a view to widening
their experience. By this he did not wish to decry the training
given in the Indian Universities, which produce some of the very
best men, and he would not make the rule absolute. It was not
necessary for men of exceptional ability to go to England in
order to occupy a high chair. Unfortunately, on account of there
being no openings for men of genius in the Educational Service,
distinguished men were driven to the profession of Law. In the
present condition of India a larger number of distinguished men
were needed to give their lives to the education of the
people.</p>
<p class="indent">"... The educational service ought to be
regarded not as a profession, but as a calling. Some men were
born to be teachers. It was not a question of race, of course; in
order to have an efficient educational system, there must be an
efficient organisation, but this should not be allowed to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_053" id=

in the way of healthy growth.... A proportion of Europeans in the
service, was needed, but only as experts and not as ordinary
teachers. Only the very best men should be obtained from Europe
and for exceptional cases. The general educational work should be
done entirely by Indians, who understood the difficulties of the
country much better than any outsider. He advocated the direct
recruitment of Indians in India by the local Government in
consultation with the Secretary of State, rather than by the
Secretary of State alone. Indians were under a great difficulty,
in that they could not remain indefinitely in England after
taking their degrees and being away from the place of recruitment
their claims were overlooked. There was no reason why a European
should be paid a higher rate of salary than an Indian on account
of the distance he came. An Indian felt a sense of inferiority if
a difference was made as regards pay. The very slight saving
which Government made by differentiating between the two did not
compensate for the feeling of wrong done. This feeling would
remain even if the pay was the same, but an additional grant in
the shape of a foreign service allowance was made to Europeans.
All workers in the field of education should feel a sense of
solidarity, because they <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_054"

cause, namely, education."<a href="#_29_" name="f29" id=

<p class="indent">Being asked by Sir Valentine Chirol, he said
"If a foreign professor would not come and serve in India for the

certainly not force him to come."<a href="#_29_" name="f29a" id=

<p class="indent">To Mr. Abdur Rahim he said: "Recruitment for
the Educational Service should be made in the first place in
India, if suitable men were available; but if not then he would
allow the best outsiders to be brought in. In the present state
of the country it would be very easy to fill up many of the
chairs by selecting the best men in India. The aim of the
universities should be to promote two classes of
work&mdash;first, research; and, secondly, an all-round sound
education...."<a href="#_29_" name="f29b" id=

<p class="indent">In answer to questions of Mr. Madge, he said:
"Any idea that the educational system of India was so far
inferior to that of England, that Indians, who had made their
mark, had done so, not because of the educational system of the
country, but in spite of it, was quite
unfounded. The standard of education prevailing in India was
quite up to the mark of several British Universities. It was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_055" id=
"Page_055">[Pg_055]</a></span>as true of any other country in the
world as of India that education was valued as a means for
passing examination, and not only for itself, and there was no
more cramming in India than elsewhere. The West certainly brought
to the East a modern spirit, which was very valuable, but it
would be dearly purchased by the loss of an honourable career for
competent Indians in their own country. The educational system in
India had in the past been too mechanical, but a turn for the
better was now taking place and the Universities were recognising
the importance of research work, and were willing to give their
highest degrees to encourage it."<a href="#_30_" name="f30" id=

<p class="indent">To Mr. Fisher, he said that he "desired to
secure for India Europeans who had European reputations in their
different branches of study. If it was necessary to go outside
India or England, to procure good men, he would prefer to go to Germany. This was the practice in
America where they were annexing all the great intellects of
Europe. He would like to see India entering the world movement in
the advance and march of knowledge. It was of the highest
importance that there should be an intellectual atmosphere in
India. It would be of advantage if there were many Indians in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_056" id=
"Page_056">[Pg_056]</a></span>Educational Service. For they came
more in contact with the people, and influenced their
intellectual activity. Besides, on retirement they would live in
India, and their ripe experience would be at their countrymen's
service."<a href="#_31_" name="f31" id=

<p class="indent">To Mr. Gokhale, he said that he "knew of three
instances in which the Colonies had secured distinguished men on
salaries which were lower than those given to officers of the
Indian Educational Service. One was at Toronto, another was in
New Zealand and the third at Yale
University. The salaries on the two latter cases were &pound;600
and &pound;500 a year. The same held good as regards Japan. The
facts there had been stated in a Government of India publication
as follows: 'Subsequent to 1895 there were 67 professors
recruited in Europe and America. Of these 20 came from Germany,
16 from England and 12 from the United States. The average pay
was &pound;384. In the highest Imperial University the average
pay is &pound;684. As soon as Japanese could be found to do the
work, even tolerably well, the foreigner was dropped.' When he
first started work in India, he found that there was no physical
laboratory, or any grant made for a practical experimental
course. He had <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_057" id=
"Page_057">[Pg_057]</a></span>to construct instruments with the
help of local mechanics, whom he had to train. All this took him
ten years. He then undertook original investigation at his own
expense. The Royal Society became specially interested in his
work and desired to give him parliamentary grant for its
continuation. It was after this that the Government of Bengal
came forward and offered him facilities for research. In the
Educational Service he would take men of achievement from any
where; but men of promise he would take from his own
country."<a href="#_32_" name="f32" id=

<p class="indent">To Sir Theodore Morison, he said: "There should
be one scale of pay for all persons in the higher Educational
Department. The rate of salary, Rs. 200 rising to Rs. 1,500 per
month, was suitable subject to the proviso that a man of great
distinction, instead of beginning at the lowest rate of pay,
should start some where in the middle of the list, say, at Rs.
400 or Rs. 500. He would make no difference in regard to
Europeans or Indians in that respect.... It would not be right
for a great Government to grant a minimum of pay to Indian
Professors and an extravagantly high pay to their <span class=

<p class="indent">To Mr. Gupta, he said that "He desired one
Service, because he thought it was most degrading that certain
man, although they were doing the same work should be classed in
a Provincial Service, while others should be classed in an
Imperial Service. The prospects of the members of the Provincial
Service were not at all what they ought to be, and that was the
reason why the best men were not attracted to it."<a href="#_33_"

FOURTH SCIENTIFIC DEPUTATION (1914-15)</p>
<p class="indent">Though the theories of Dr. Bose received
acceptance from the leading scientific men of the Royal Society,
yet Dr. Bose realised the necessity of bringing about a
<i>general conviction</i> as to the truth of the identity of
life-reactions in plant and in animal. So he looked for an
opportunity of giving demonstration of his discoveries before the
leading Scientific Societies of the World. And that opportunity
came. The Royal Institution of Great Britain again invited him to
deliver a 'Friday evening discourse' on the results of his new
researches. The University of Oxford and Cambridge <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_059" id=
"Page_059">[Pg_059]</a></span>also followed suit. The Government
of India also showed their appreciation by sending him again on a
Deputation for placing his discoveries before the Scientific
world. He remained on deputation from the 3rd April 1914 to the
12th June 1915.</p>

"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
DR. BOSE IN EUROPE</p>
<p class="indent">Proceeding on his Deputation to England, Dr.
Bose gave his first lecture, on the 20th May 1914, at
Oxford,&mdash;where the late Sir John Burden Sanderson and his
followers were the leaders of biological thought&mdash;in
presence of very distinguished scientists. It was a grand
success. Actual visualisation by physical demonstration of the
results of his novel researches at once convinced those who were
present. He next proposed to give a discourse on Plant Response
before the University of Cambridge. The interest in this lecture
became so very keen that the Botanical Department of Cambridge
went to the length of importing soil from India to give the
plants the most favourable conditions for exhibiting their
specific reactions. At the lecture, the large Botanical Theatre
became filled with scientific specialists, dons and advanced
students, who followed with great attention the experiments with
which he illustrated his discourse. He was greeted <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_060" id=
"Page_060">[Pg_060]</a></span>with applause by the eminent
scientists who thronged the lecture-theatre, at the end of every
experiment. Sir Francis Darwin, the eminent botanist, in
proposing a vote of thanks to Dr. Bose, said that 'he was filled
with admiration, not only for the brilliancy of the work but for
the convincing character of the experiments.' The scientists next
assembled in great force, on the 29th May 1914, to hear the
'Friday Evening Discourse' of Dr. J. C. Bose on 'Plant Autographs
and their Revelations,' at the Royal Institution, which was
highly appreciated. At the end of the Discourse, Sir James Dewar,
President of the Institution, gave an 'At Home' in honour of Dr.

THE MAIDA VALE LABORATORY</p>
<p class="indent">The demonstrations of a far-reaching character
which Dr. Bose gave evoked considerable public interest in
England. His private laboratory at Maida Vale, in London, became
the object of pilgrimage to the leading men of thought there. Sir
William Crookes, the President of the Royal Society, came and
became 'much impressed by the most ingenious and novel
self-recording instruments.' Professor Starling, the author of
the standard work on Physiology, and Professor <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_061" id=
"Page_061">[Pg_061]</a></span>Oliver, the well-known
Plant Physiologist, also became impressed by the delicacy and
importance of Dr. Bose's work and methods. Professor Carveth
Read, author of "Metaphysics of Nature," wondered how far the
researches would profoundly affect the philosophical thoughts.
Mr. Balfour, the ex-premier, became enthralled with what he saw.
Professor James A. H. Murray, Editor of the 'Oxford New English
Dictionary,' and Bernard Shaw, the famous dramatist, felt
themselves attracted to the great Indian Scientist and came to
pay their homage to him. Even Lord Crewe, the then Secretary of
State for India, paid a visit to his laboratory and spoke warmly
of the pride which he and the Government of India felt for his
discoveries and of high gratification to him that India should
once more make such contributions for the intellectual
advancement of the world. The leading newspapers wrote
eulogistically of his researches. The well-known scientific
journal <i>Nature</i> devoted ten columns to an illustrated
synopsis of his discoveries. Lord Hardinge, the then Viceroy,
wrote a congratulatory letter to him&mdash;"It has been a source
of immense gratification to the Viceroy to know that the foremost
place in the special branch of research has been taken by one of
India's most distinguished sons. The success you have won will
only serve to stimulate your efforts and those of your pupils to
other scientific investigations <span class='pagenum'><a name=

still further to the honour of those who conduct them, and of
India, the country of their birth."<a href="#_35_" name="f35" id=

<p class="indent">From England Dr. Bose proceeded to the
Continent, where his researches had already evoked keen
interest.</p>
<p class="indent">On the 27th June 1914, he gave an address,
illustrated with experiments, before the University of Vienna,
which stands foremost in Biological researches. He was greeted
with enthusiasm by the savants there. Some of the workers in
plant physiology became so very much impressed with his
demonstrations that they expressed a desire to be trained under
him. Professor Molisch, the Director of the
Pflanzen-physiologisches Institute of the Imperial University of
Vienna, in proposing a vote of thanks, spoke highly of the great
inspiration which the Viennese scientific men received from his
discourse and dwelt on the indebtedness of Europe to India for
the method of investigation initiated by Dr. Bose&mdash;method,
which rendered it possible to prove deep into plant-life and
bring forth results of which they could not hitherto dream. And
the University of Vienna officially addressed the Secretary of
State for India asking that special thanks of the University be
conveyed to the Government of <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_063" id="Page_063">[Pg_063]</a></span>India for the impetus
given to them by Dr. Bose's visit. Dr. Bose was next to start for
Germany on his scientific mission, and address the University of
Strassburg, Leipzic, Halle, Berlin and Bonn and then attend the
international congress at Munich, but, as the War broke out, he
was compelled to come back to London.<a href="#_36_" name="f36"
id="f36"><sup>36</sup></a> On his way back, he gave a Discourse
before the eminent scientific men in Paris.</p>
<p class="indent">On his return to London, medical men evinced
great interest in his researches. Sir John Reid, President of the
Royal Society of Medicine, and Sir Lauder Brunton, Physician of
His Majesty the King Emperor, paid a visit to his laboratory to
witness the action of drugs upon plants. Sir Lauder Brunton
became of opinion that 'much light would be thrown on action of
drugs on animals, by first observing their effects on plants.' As
a result of this visit, Dr. Bose was invited to give an address
to the Royal Society of Medicine in the beginning of winter. But,
as the period of his Deputation was about to expire, the Society
cabled to the Government of India for an extension, which was
granted. Dr. Bose then delivered a lecture, before the Royal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_064" id=
"Page_064">[Pg_064]</a></span>Society of Medicine, on the 30th
October 1914. The Royal Society of Medicine officially addressed
the Secretary of State for India as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquot">"... The lecture was one of the most
successful we have had yet and evoked the keenest interest in the
audience, Sir Lauder Brunton, Bt., and others taking part in the
discussion, and warmly congratulating Prof. Bose and the Society
on the value of his work. Since then I have received many
expressions of appreciation that the Society was able to offer
its fellows such an interesting demonstration of an entirely new
departure in Biological Science." "At the invitation of the
Psychological Society of London, Dr. Bose next delivered an
interesting lecture on his theory of Memory Image."<a href=

DR. BOSE IN AMERICA</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. Bose's discoveries in the meantime evoked
great interest in America. He was invited by several leading
scientific bodies to come over there and acquaint them with the
results of his wonderful researches. So he next went to America.
"While in America, he was swamped with letters and telegrams for
lecture engagements from Maine to <span class='pagenum'><a name=

from various Scientific societies, Colleges and Universities,
that if he could speak twice a day and every day in the week, he
could not hope to comply with all of those invitations in much
less than a year." As he was in the United States, only for a few
weeks, "he spoke before such learned bodies as the New York
Academy of Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement
of Science, the Brooklyn Institute of
Arts and Science, the Philosophical Society of Philadelphia, and
joint meeting of Academy of Science, the Botanical Society, and
the Bureau of Plant Industry at Washington. Among the larger
Universities, he gave addresses at Harvard, Columbia, Iowa,
Illinois, Chicago, Michigan, Wisconsin.... Everywhere Dr. Bose
has met with a very hearty welcome from the people of the
American Republic. Even the Hon'ble Secretary of State, William
Jennings Bryan, invited him to give a demonstration of his work
at the State Department in Washington&mdash;an honour of unusual
significance.... Dr. Bose has been made the subject of many
magazine articles, newspaper editorials, cartoons and
poems"<a href="#_38_" name="f38a" id="f38a"><sup>38</sup></a>....
"The famous Smithsonian <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_066"
id="Page_066">[Pg_066]</a></span>Institute showed its high
appreciation by submitting a report of Prof. Bose's work to the
Congress. The Bureau of Plant Industry in Washington recognised
his work on plant physiology as a very important contribution for
the advancement of agriculture.... At the Harvard University his
work has been received with high appreciation. President Stanley
Hall, who is one of the leading psychologists of the day, has
introduced Prof. Bose's work in the Post-graduate course of the
Clarke University. His books have also been prescribed for
physiological courses in different Universities in America, and
in one of the leading Universities there, a special course of
lectures is devoted to Prof. Bose's investigations on
plant irritability...."<a href="#_39_" name="f39" id=

apparatus and methods."</p>

WHAT DR. BOSE SAW IN JAPAN</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. Bose then came back to India, in June 1915,
<i>via</i> Japan. During his stay, in Japan, he acquainted
himself with the efforts of the people and their aspirations
towards a great future. He found that, <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_067" id="Page_067">[Pg_067]</a></span>"in
materialistic efficiency, which, in a mechanical era, is regarded
as an index of civilisation, they have surpassed their German
teachers. A few decades ago, they had no foreign shipping and no
manufactures. But, within an incredibly short time, their
magnificent lines of steamers have
proved so formidable a competitor that the great American lines
in the Pacific will soon be compelled to stop their sailings.
Their industries again, through the wise help of the State and
other adventitious aids, are capturing foreign markets. But far
more admirable is their foresight to save their country from any
embroilment with other nations with whom they want to live in
peace. And they realise that any predominant interest of a
foreign country in their trade or manufacture is sure to lead to
misunderstanding and friction. Actuated by this idea, they have
practically excluded all foreign manufactured articles by
prohibitive tariffs."<a href="#_40_" name="f40" id=
"f40"><sup>40</sup></a> "Is our country slow to realise the
danger" asks Dr. Bose "that threatens her by the capture of her
market and the total destruction of her industries? Does she not
realise that it is helpless passivity that directly provokes
aggression?... There is, therefore, no time to be lost and the
utmost effort is demanded of the Government and the people for

<p class="indent">"A very serious danger" continues Dr. Bose "is
thus seen to be threatening the future of India, and to avert it
will require the utmost effort of the people. They have not only
to meet the economic crisis but also to protect the ideals of
ancient Aryan civilisation from the destructive forces that are
threatening it.... There is a danger of regarding the mechanical
efficiency as the sole end of life; there is also the opposite
danger of a life of dreaming, bereft of struggle and activity,
the degenerating into parasitic habits of dependence. Only
through the noble call of patriotism can our nation realise the
highest ideals in thought and in action...."<a href="#_42_" name=

BACK TO INDIA</p>
<p class="indent">After his return to India, Dr. Bose attended
the Indian Science Congress at Lucknow. He then attended the
ceremony of the laying of the foundation stone of the Hindu
University at Benares. On that occasion he delivered a masterly
address. He said:&mdash;</p>
<p class="indent">"In tracing the characteristic phenomena of
life from simple beginnings in that vast region which may be
called unvoiced, as exemplified in the world of plants, to its
highest expression in the animal <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_069" id="Page_069">[Pg_069]</a></span>kingdom, one is
repeatedly struck by the one dominant fact that in order to
maintain an organism at the height of its efficiency something
more than a mechanical perfection of its structure is necessary.
Every living organism, in order to maintain its life and growth,
must be in free communion with all the forces of the Universe
about it.</p>
<p class="indent">"Further, it must not only constantly receive
stimulus from without, but must also give out something from
within, and the healthy life of the organism will depend on these
two-fold activities of inflow and outflow. When there is any
interference with these activities, then morbid symptoms appear,
which ultimately must end in disaster and death. This is equally
true of the intellectual life of a Nation. When through narrow
conceit a Nation regards itself self-sufficient and cuts itself
from the stimulus of the outside world, then intellectual decay
must inevitably follow.</p>
<p class="indent">"So far as regards the receptive function. Then
there is another function in the intellectual life of a Nation,
that of spontaneous flow, that going out of its life by which the
world is enriched. When the Nation has lost this power, when it
merely receives, but cannot give out, then its healthy life is
over, and it sinks into a degenerate existence, which is purely
parasitic.</p>
<p class="indent">"How can our Nation give out of the fulness of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_070" id=
"Page_070">[Pg_070]</a></span>the life that is in it, and how can
a new Indian University help in the realisation of this object?
It is clear that its power of directing and inspiring will depend
on its world status. This can be secured to it by no artificial
means, nor by any strength in the past....</p>
<p class="indent">"This world status can only be won by the
intrinsic value of the great contributions to be made by its own
Indian scholars for the advancement of the world's knowledge. To
be organic and vital our new University must stand primarily for
self-expression and for winning for India a place she has lost.
Knowledge is never the exclusive possession of any particular
race, nor does it recognise geographical limitations. The whole
world is interdependent, and a constant stream of thought has
been carried out throughout the ages enriching the common
heritage of mankind. Although science was neither of the East nor
of the West but international, certain aspects of it gained
richness by reason of their place of origin."<a href="#_43_"

was a great success. The very convincing character of the
demonstrations that he gave, before the <span class=

world, with his newly invented Resonant Recorder and other
delicate instruments, secured a world-wide acceptance of his
theories and results. Not only that. He secured also a
recognition from the leading thinkers of "that trend of thought
which led him unconsciously to the dividing frontiers of
different sciences and shaped the course of his work."<a href=
"#_44_" name="f44" id="f44"><sup>44</sup></a> It has come to be
recognised that "India through her habit of mind is peculiarly
fitted to realise the idea of unity and to see in the phenomenal
world an orderly universe," to realise that "there can be but one
truth, one Science which includes all other branches of
knowledge,"<a href="#_44_" name="f44a" id=

would be incomplete without India's special contribution to it.

lay in his power. So he proceeded to build and equip an
Institute&mdash;the "Bose Institute"&mdash;at a cost of about 5
lakhs, the entire savings of his lifetime. While it was being
constructed Their Excellencies the Viceroy and the <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_074" id=
"Page_074">[Pg_074]</a></span>Governor of Bengal paid a visit to
Dr. Bose's private laboratory. On the 30th November
1917&mdash;the anniversary of his sixtieth birthday&mdash;he
dedicated the Institute to the Nation, for the progress of
Science and for the Glory of India.</p>
<p style=

THE AIMS OF THE INSTITUTE</p>
<p class="indent">In this Institute, Dr. Bose intends to go on
with "the further and fuller investigation of the many and
ever-opening problems of the nascent science which includes both
Life and None Life" and wants to train up a devoted band of
workers, with the Sanyasin mind, who would keep alive the flame
kindled by him, and who, by acute observation and patient
experiment would "wring out from Nature some of her most
jealously guarded secrets" and who would thus lead to the
establishment of a great Indian School of Science and to the
"building of the greater India yet to be." There would be no
academic limitation here to the widest possible diffusion of
knowledge. The facilities of the Institute would be available to
workers from all countries and there would be no desecration of
knowledge here by its utilisation for personal gain&mdash;no
patent would be taken of the discoveries here made. The high aim
of a great Seat of Learning would be sought to be maintained
here. The lectures here given would not be mere repetitions,
second-hand knowledge but would announce <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_075" id="Page_075">[Pg_075]</a></span>for
the first time to the world the new discoveries here
made.<a href="#_47_" name="f47" id="f47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">The efforts of Dr. Bose have also animated our
countrymen. Maharaja Sir Manindra Chandra Nandy of Kasimbazar has
made a gift of two lakhs to the Institute. Mr. S. R. Bomanji has
given one lakh. Mr. Moolraj Khatao has endowed the Institute with
two lakh and a quarter. Other contributions are still pouring
in.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
A GREAT 'SADHAK'</p>
<p class="indent">With a true <i>Sanyasin</i> spirit, Dr. Bose
applied himself to the study of Nature. His ardour was ever
compassable. Even the limitations of the senses would hardly
fetter him in his explorations in the regions of the Unknown. He
expended the range of perception by means of wonderfully
sensitive instrumental devices. By acute observations and patient
experiment he wrung out from Nature some of her most jealously
guarded secrets in the realm of Electric Radiation, which
"literally filled with wonder and admiration" the greatest
scientist of the age. Allurements of great material
prospects&mdash;which might lead him to the path of immense
fortune&mdash;came to him, in the shape of the patents of his
inventions. But they had no attraction for <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_076" id=
"Page_076">[Pg_076]</a></span>him. In utter disregard of all
worldly advancement, he continued in his pursuit of
knowledge.</p>
<p class="indent">In pursuit of his investigations on Electric
Radiation, he was unconsciously led into the border region of
Physics and Physiology. He caught a glimpse of ineffable wonder
that remained hidden behind the view. He attempted to lift the
veil. And, at once, difficulties presented themselves one after
another. An unfamiliar caste in the domain of Science got
offended. He was asked not to encroach on the special preserve of
the Physiologists and, as he did not pay any heed to the warning,
misrepresentations began. Even the evidence of his
supersensitive appliances failed to convince many. And the Royal
Society withheld publication of his researches. He was
recompensed with ridicule and reviling. The limited facilities
that he had in the prosecution of his researches were in danger
of being withdrawn. But he had a burning Faith in the Vision and
was not to be boggled at with these difficulties. He became
stronger in his determination. Realising an inner call, he
dedicated himself for the establishment of the truth underlying
his Faith. He cast his life, as an offering, regarding success
and failure as one, and engaged himself in a protracted struggle
to get behind the deceptive seeming into the reality that
remained unseen. After years of sustained efforts, <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_077" id="Page_077">[Pg_077]</a></span>he
succeeded in overcoming almost insuperable difficulties in the
way of the realisation of the great dream of his life. The closed
doors at last opened, and the seemingly impossible became
possible. The secret of the plant world stood revealed by the
autographs of the plants themselves. "It was when I came upon the
mute witness of these self-made records," said Sir J. C. Bose,
when he stood before the Royal Institution "and perceived in them
one phase of a pervading unity that bears within it all things:
the mote that quivers in ripples of light, the teeming life upon
our earth, and the radiant suns that shine above us&mdash;it was
then that I understood for the first time a little of that
message proclaimed by my ancestors on the banks of the Ganges
thirty centuries ago."</p>
<p class="blockquot">"They who see but one in all the changing
manifestations of this universe, unto them belongs Eternal
Truth&mdash;unto none else, unto none else."<a href="#_48_" name=
"f48" id="f48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">The Rishis of ancient India, by their intense
Yoga, realised the One in the Many. But Sir Jagadis Chandra, by
rigorous experimental demonstration, realised a Unity amidst
Diversity. He perceived that "there was no such thing as brute
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_078" id=
"Page_078">[Pg_078]</a></span>matter, but that spirit suffused
matter in which it was enshrined."<a href="#_49_" name="f49" id=
"f49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
EFFECT OF HIS WORK</p>
<p class="indent">It is impossible to estimate the effect of his
epoch-making researches. The psychic stone flung by him into the
pool of physical botany, has made the ripples run in so many
directions. There have been produced "unexpected revelations in
plant life, foreshadowing the wonders of the highest animal
life." And there "have opened out very extended regions of
inquiry in Physics, in Physiology, in Medicine, in Agriculture
and even in Psychology. Problems, hitherto regarded as insoluble,
have now been brought within the sphere of experimental
investigation."</p>
<p class="indent">Sir J.C. Bose has not only extended the distant
boundaries of Science, but, by his peculiarly Indian
contribution, has secured a recognised place for India and has
revived a hope in the Indian mind that India may yet regain a
place among the intellectual nations of the world. Men like him
are rare not only in India but rare any where in the world. May
he live long!</p>

LITERATURE <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_079" id=
"Page_079">[Pg_079]</a></span>AND SCIENCE</p>
<p class="indent">The following is a substance of the Address
delivered in Bengali by Prof. J. C. Bose, on the 14th April 1911,
as the President of the Bengal Literary Conference, which met in
the Easter of 1911 at Mymensing.</p>
<p class="indent">In this Literary Congress it would appear that
you have interpreted Letters in no exclusive sense. We are not
met to discuss the place that literature is to hold in the gospel
of beauty. Rather are we set upon conceiving of her in larger
ways. To us to-day literature is no mere ornament, no mere
amusement. Instead of this, we desire to bring beneath her shadow
all the highest efforts of our minds. In this great communion of
learning, this is not the first time that a scientific man has
officiated as priest. The chair which I now occupy has already
been held by one whom I love and honour as friend and colleague,
and glory in our countryman, Praphulla Chandra Ray. In honouring
him, your Society has not only done homage to merit, but has also
placed before our people a lofty and inclusive ideal of
literature.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_080" id=
"Page_080">[Pg_080]</a></span>You are aware that in this West,
the prevailing tendency at the moment is, after a period of
synthesis, to return upon the excessive sub-division of learning.
The result of this specialisation is rather to accentuate the
distinctiveness of the various sciences, so that for a while the
great unity of all tends perhaps to be obscured. Such a
caste system in scholarship, undoubtedly helps at first, in the
gathering and classification of new material. But if followed too
exclusively, it ends by limiting the comprehensiveness of truth.
The search is endless. Realisation evades us.</p>
<p class="indent">The Eastern aim has been rather the opposite,
namely, that in the multiplicity of phenomena, we should never
miss their underlying unity. After generations of this quest, the
idea of unity comes to us almost spontaneously, and we apprehend
no insuperable obstacle in grasping it.</p>
<p class="indent">I feel that here in this Literary Congress,
this characteristic idea of unity has worked unconsciously. We
have never thought of narrowing the bounds of literature by a
jealous definition of its limits. On the contrary, we have
allowed its empire to extend. And you have felt that this could
be adequately done only, if in one place you could gather
together all that we are seeking, all that we are thinking, all
that we are examining. And for this you have to-day invited those
who sing along <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_081" id=
"Page_081">[Pg_081]</a></span>with those who meditate, and those
who experiment. And this is why, though my own life has been
given to the pursuit of science, I had yet no hesitation in
accepting the honour of your invitation.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
POETRY AND SCIENCE</p>
<p class="indent">The poet, seeing by the heart, realises the
inexpressible and strived to give it expression. His imagination
soars, where the sight of others fails, and his news of realm
unknown finds voice in rhyme and metre. The
path of the scientific man may be different, yet there is some
likeness between the two pursuits. Where visible light ends, he
still follows the invisible. Where the note of the audible
reaches the unheard, even there he gathers the tremulous message.
That mystery which lies behind the expressed, is the object of
his questioning also; and he, in his scientific way, attempts to
render its abstruse discoveries into human speech.</p>
<p class="indent">This vast abode of nature is built in many
wings, each with its own portal. The physicist, the chemist, and
the biologist entering by different doors, each one his own
department of knowledge, comes to think that this is his special
domain, unconnected with that of any other. Hence has arisen our
present rigid division of phenomena, into the worlds of the
inorganic, vegetal, and sentient. But
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_082" id=
"Page_082">[Pg_082]</a></span>this attitude of mind is
philosophical, may be denied. We must remember that all
enquiries have as their goal the attainment of
knowledge in its entirety. The partition walls between the cells
in the great laboratory are only erected for a time to aid this
search. Only at that point where all lines of investigation meet,
can the whole truth be found.</p>
<p class="indent">Both poet and scientific worker have set out
for the same goal, to find a unity in the bewildering diversity.
The difference is that the poet thinks little of the path,
whereas the scientific man must not neglect. The imagination of
the poet has to be unrestricted. The intuitions of emotion cannot
be established by rigid proof. He has, therefore, to use the
language of imagery, adding constantly the words 'as if.'</p>
<p class="indent">The road that the scientific man has to tread
is on the other hand very rugged, and in his pursuit of
demonstration he must pay a severe restraint on his imagination.
His constant anxiety is lest he should be self-deceived. He has,
therefore, at every step to compare his own thought with the
external fact. He has remorselessly to abandon all in which these
are not agreed. His reward is that he gets, however little is
certain, forming a strong foundation for what is yet to come.
Even by this path of self-restraint and verification, however, he
is <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_083" id=
"Page_083">[Pg_083]</a></span>making for a region surpassing
wonder. In the range of that invisible light, gross objects cease
to be a barrier, and force and matter become less aesthetic. When
the veil is suddenly lifted, upon the vision hitherto
unsuspected, he may for a moment lose his accustomed
self-restraint and, exclaim "not 'as if'&mdash;but the thing
itself!"</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
INVISIBLE LIGHT.</p>
<p class="indent">In illustration of this sense of wonder which
links together poetry and science, let me allude briefly to a few
matters that belong to my own small corner in the great universe
of knowledge, that of light invisible and of life unvoiced. Can
anything appeal more to the imagination than the fact that we can
detect the peculiarities in the internal molecular structure of
an opaque body by means of light that is itself invisible? Could
anything have been more unexpected than to find that a sphere of
China-clay focuses invisible light more perfectly
than a sphere of glass focuses the visible; that
in fact, the refractive power of this clay to electric radiation
is at least as great as that of the most costly diamond to light?
From amongst the innumerable octaves of light, there is only one
octave, with power to excite the human eye. In reality, we stand,
in the midst of a luminous ocean, almost blind! The little that
we can see is nothing, compared to the vastness of <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_084" id=
"Page_084">[Pg_084]</a></span>that which we cannot. But it may be
said that out of the very imperfection of his senses man has been
able, in science, to build for himself a raft of thought by which
to make daring adventure on the great seas of the unknown.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
UNVOICED LIFE.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, just as, in following up light from
visible to invisible, our range of investigation transcends our
physical sight, so also does our power of sympathy become
extended, when we pass from the voiced to the unvoiced, in the
study of life: Is there then any possible relation between our
own life and that of the plant world? That there may be such a
relation, some of the foremost of scientific men have denied. So
distinguished a leader as the late Burdon-Sanderson declared that
the majority of plants were not capable of giving any answer, by
either mechanical or electrical excitement, to an outside stock.
Pfeffer, again, and his distinguished followers, have insisted
that the plants have neither a nervous system, nor anything
analogous to the nervous impulse of the animal. According to such
a view, that two streams of life, in plant and animal, flow side
by side, but under the guidance of different laws. The problems
of vegetable life are, it must be said, extremely obscure, and
for the penetrating <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_085" id=
"Page_085">[Pg_085]</a></span>of that darkness we have long had
to wait for instruments of a superlative sensitiveness. This has
been the principal reason for our long clinging to mere theory,
instead of looking for the demonstration of facts. But to learn
the truth we have to put aside theories, and rely only on direct
experiment. We have to abandon all our preconceptions, and put
our questions direct, insisting that the only evidence we can
accept is that which bears the plant's own signature.</p>
<p class="indent">How are we to know what unseen changes take
place within the plant? If it be excited or depressed by some
special circumstance, how are we, on the outside, to be made
aware of this? The only conceivable way would be, if that were
possible, to detect and measure the actual response of the
organism to a definite external blow. When an animal receives an
external shock it may answer in various ways if it has voice, by
a cry; if it be dumb, by the movement of its limbs. The external
shock is a stimulus; the answer of the organism is the response.
If we can find out the relation between this stimulus and the
response, we shall be able to determine the vitality of the plant
at that moment. In an excitable condition, the feeblest stimulus
will evoke an extraordinarily large response: in a depressed
state, even a strong stimulus evokes only a feeble response; and
lastly, when <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_086" id=
"Page_086">[Pg_086]</a></span>death has overcome life, there is
an abrupt end of the power to answer at all.</p>
<p class="indent">We might therefore have detected the internal
condition of the plant, if, by some inducement, we could have
made it write down its own responses. If we could once succeed in
this apparently impossible task we should still have to learn the
new language and the new script. In a world of so many different
scripts, it is certainly undesirable to introduce a new one! I
fear the Uniform Script Association will cherish a grievance
against us for this. It is fortunate however that the
plant-script bears, after all, a certain resemblance to the
Devanagari&mdash;inasmuch as it is totally unintelligible to any
but the very learned!</p>
<p class="indent">But there are two serious difficulties in our
path; first, to make the plant itself consent to give its
evidence; second, through plant and instrument combined, to
induce it to give it in writing. It is comparatively easy to make
a rebellious child obey: to extort answers from plants is indeed
a problem! By many years of close contiguity, however, I have
come to have some understanding of their ways. I take this
opportunity to make public confession of various acts of cruelty
which I have from time to time perpetrated on unoffending plants,
in order to compel them to give me answers. For this purpose, I
have devised various forms of torment,&mdash;<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_087" id=
"Page_087">[Pg_087]</a></span>pinches simple and revolving,
pricks with needles, and burns with acids. But let this pass. I
now understand that replies so forced are unnatural, and of no
value. Evidence so obtained is not to be trusted. Vivisection,
for instance, cannot furnish unimpugnable results, for excessive
shock tends of itself to make the response of a tissue abnormal.
The experimental organism must therefore be subjected only to
moderate stimulation. Again, one has to choose for one's
experiment a favourable moment. Amongst plants, as with
ourselves, there is, very early in the morning, especially after
a cold night, certain sluggishness. The answers, then, are a
little indistinct. In the excessive heat of
midday, again, though the first few answers are very distinct,
yet fatigue soon sets in. On a stormy day, the plant remains
obstinately silent. Barring all these sources of aberration,
however, if we choose our time wisely, we may succeed in
obtaining clear answers, which persist without interruption.</p>
<p class="indent">It is our object, then, to gather the whole
history of the plant, during every moment between its birth and
its death. Through how many cycle of experience it has to pass!
The effects on it of recurring light and darkness; the pull of
the earth, and the blow of the storm; how complex is the
concatenation of circumstances, how
various are the shocks, and how multiplex are the replies which
we have <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_088" id=

which appears so placid and so stationary, how manifold are the
subtle internal reactions! Then how are we to make this invisible
visible?</p>

THE DIARY OF THE PLANT.</p>
<p class="indent">The little seedling we know to be growing, but
the rate of its growth is far below anything we can directly
perceive. How are we to magnify this so as
to make it instantly measurable? What are the variations in this
infinitesimal growth under external shock? what changes are
induced by the action of drugs or poisons? will the action of
poison change with the dose? Is it possible to counteract the
effect of one by another?</p>
<p class="indent">Supposing that the plant does not give answers
to external shock, what time elapses between the shock and the
reply? Does this latent period undergo any variation with
external conditions? Is it possible to make the plant itself
write down this excessively minute time-interval?</p>
<p class="indent">Next, does the effect of the blow given outside
reach the interior of the plant? If so, is there anything
analogous to the nerve of the animal? If so, again, at what rate
does the nervous impulse travel the plant? By what favourable
circumstances will this rate of transmission become enhanced, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_089" id=
"Page_089">[Pg_089]</a></span>by what will be retarded or
arrested? Is it possible to make the plant itself record this
rate and its variations? Is there any resemblance between the
nervous impulse in plants and animals? In the animal there are
certain automatically pulsating tissues like the heart. Are there
any such spontaneously beating tissues in a plant? What is the
meaning of spontaneity? And lastly, when by the blow of death,
life itself is finally extinguished, will it be possible to
detect the critical moment? And does the plant then exert itself
to make one overwhelming reply, after which response ceases
altogether? Its autobiography can only be regarded as complete,
if, with the help of efficient instruments, all these questions
can be answered by it, so as to form the different chapters.</p>
<p class="indent">"If the plant could have been made thus to keep
its own diary, then the whole of its history might have been
recovered!" But words like these are born of day dreams merely. Vague imaginings of this kind may
furnish much gratification to an idle life. When, awaking from
these pleasant dreams of science, we seek to actualise the
conditions imposed by them, we find ourselves face to face with a
dead wall. For the doorway of nature's court is barred with iron,
and through it can penetrate no mere cry of childish petulance.
It is only by the gathered force of many years of concentration,
that the gate <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_090" id=

DIFFICULTIES OF RESEARCH IN INDIA.</p>
<p class="indent">We often hear that without a properly equipped
laboratory, higher research in this country is an absolute
impossibility. But while there is a good deal in this, it is not
by any means the whole truth. If it were all, then from these
countries where millions have been spent on costly laboratories,
we should have had daily accounts of new discoveries. Such news
we do not hear. It is true that here we suffer from many
difficulties, but how does it help us, to envy the good fortune
of others? Rise from your depression! Cast off your weakness! Let
us think, "In whatever condition we are placed, that is the true
starting-point for us." India is our working-place, and all our
duties are to be accomplished here, and nowhere else. Only he who
has lost his manhood need repine.</p>
<p class="indent">In carrying out research, there are other
difficulties, besides the want of well-equipped laboratories. We
often forget that the real laboratory is one's own mind. The room
and the instruments only externalise that. Every experiment has
first to be carried out in that inner region. To keep the mental
vision clear, great struggles have to be <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_091" id=
"Page_091">[Pg_091]</a></span>undergone. For its clearness is
lost, only too easily. The greatest wealth of external appliances
is of no avail, where there is not a concentrated pursuit,
utterly detached from personal gain. Those whose minds rush
hither and thither, those who hunger for public applause instead
of truth itself, by them the quest is not won. To those on the
other hand, who do long for knowledge itself, the want of
favourable conditions does not seem the principle obstacle.</p>
<p class="indent">In the first place, we have to realise that
knowledge for the sake of knowledge is our aim, and that the
world's common standard of utility have no place in it. The
enquirer must follow where he is led, holding the quiet faith
that things which appear to-day to be of no use, may be of the
highest interest to-morrow. No height can be climbed, without the
hewing of many an unremembered step! It is necessary, then, that
the enquirer and his disciples should work on ceaselessly,
undeterred by years of failure, and undistracted by the thunder
of public applause. We may one day come to realise that India in
the past has shared her knowledge with the world, and we may ask
ourselves, is that destiny now ended for us? Are we of to-day to
be debtors only? Perhaps when we have once felt this, a new
Nalanda may arise.</p>

THE <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_092" id=
"Page_092">[Pg_092]</a></span>PHYTOGRAPH</p>
<p class="indent">I was speaking of the need of various delicate
instruments&mdash;phytographs, as I shall call them&mdash;for the
automatic record of the plant's responses. What was, ten years
ago, a mere aspiration, has now after so many years of effort,
become actual fact. It is unnecessary to tell here of many a
fruitless and despairing attempt. Nor shall I trouble you with
any account of intricate mechanism. I need only say that with the
aid of different types of apparatus, it is now possible for all
the responsive activities of the plant to be written down. For
instance, we can make an instantaneous record of the growth and
its variations, moment by moment. Scripts can be obtained of its
spontaneous movement. And a recording arm will demorcate
the line of life from that of death. The
extreme delicacy of one of these instruments will be understood,
when it is said that it measures and records a time-interval so
short as one-thousandth part of a second!</p>
<p class="indent">It has been supposed that instruments for
research of this delicacy and precision, were only possible of
construction in the best scientific manufactories of Europe. It
will therefore be regarded as interesting and encouraging to know
that every one of these has been executed entirely in India, by
Indian workmen and mechanicians.</p>
<p class="indent">With perfect instruments at our disposal, we
may <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_093" id=
"Page_093">[Pg_093]</a></span>proceed to describe a few amongst
the many phenomena which now stand revealed. But before this, it
is necessary to deal briefly with the superstition that has led
to the division of plants into sensitive and insensitive. By the
electrical mode of investigation, it can be shown that not only
Mimosa and the like, but all plants of all kinds are sensitive,
and give definite replies to impinging stimuli. Ordinary plants,
it is true, are unable to give any conspicuous mechanical
indication of excitement. But this is not because of any
insensitiveness, but because of equal and antagonistic reactions
which neutralise each other. It is possible, however, by
employing appropriate means, to show that even ordinary plants
give mechanical replies to stimulus.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
THE DETERMINATION OF THE LATENT PERIOD</p>
<p class="indent">When an animal is struck by a blow, it does not
respond at once. A certain short interval elapses between the
incidence of the blow, and the beginning of the reply. This lost
time is known as the latent period. In the leg of a frog, the
latent period according to Helmwoltz, is about one-hundredth of a
second. This latent period, however, undergoes appropriate
variation with changing external conditions. With feeble
stimulus, it has a definite value, which, with an excessive blow,
is much <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_094" id=
"Page_094">[Pg_094]</a></span>shortened. In the cold season, it
is relatively long. Again, when we are tired our perception time,
as we may call it, may be greatly prolonged. Every one of these
observations is equally applicable to the perception time of the
plant. In Mimosa, in a vigorous condition, the latent period is
six one hundredth of a second, that is to say, only six times its
value in an energetic frog! Another
curious thing is that a stoutish tree will give its response in a
slow and lordly fashion, whereas a thin one attains the acme of
its excitement in an incredibly short time! Perhaps some of us
can tell from our own experience whether similar differences
obtain amongst human kind or not? The plant's latent period in
our cold weather may be almost doubled. Ordinarily speaking it
takes <i>Mimosa</i> about fifteen minutes
to recover from a blow. If a second blow be given, before the
full recovery of its equanimity, then the plant becomes fatigued,
and its latent period is lengthened. When over-fatigued, it may
temporarily lose its power of perception altogether, what this
condition is like, my audience is only too likely to realise, at
the end of my long address!</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
THE RELATION BETWEEN STIMULUS AND RESPONSE</p>
<p class="indent">According to varying circumstances, the same
blow will evoke responses of different amplitudes. <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_095" id=
"Page_095">[Pg_095]</a></span>Early in the morning, after the
prolonged inactivity of a cold night, we find the plant inclined
to be lethargic, and its first answers correspondingly small. But
as blow after blow is delivered, this lethargy passes off, and
the replies become stronger and stronger. A good way to remove
this lethargy quickly, is to give the plant a warm bath. In the
heat of the midday, this state of things is reversed. That is to
say, after giving vigorous replies the plant becomes fatigued,
and its responses grow smaller. This fatigue passes off, however,
on allowing it a period of rest. On increasing the intensity of
the impinging stimulus, the response also increases. But a limit
is attained, beyond which response can no longer be enhanced.
Again, just as the pain of a blow persists longer with ourselves,
in winter than in summer, so the same holds good of the reaction
of the plant also. For instance, in summer it takes <i>Mimosa</i>
ten to fifteen minutes to recover from a blow, whereas in winter
the same thing would take over half an hour. In all this, you
will recognise the similarity between human response and that of
the plant.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
SPONTANEOUS PULSATION</p>
<p class="indent">In certain tissues, a very curious phenomenon
is observed. In man and other animals, there are tissues which
beat, as we say, spontaneously. As <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_096" id="Page_096">[Pg_096]</a></span>long as life lasts,
so long does the heart continue to pulsate. There is no effect
without a cause. How then was it that these pulstations
[became spontaneous? To this query, no
fully satisfactory answer has been forthcoming. We find, however,
that similar spontaneous movements are also observable in plant
tissues, and by their investigation the secret of automatism in
the animal may perhaps be unravelled.</p>
<p class="indent">Physiologists, in order to know the heart of
man, play with those of the frog and tortoise. "To know the
heart," be it understood, is here meant in a purely physical, and
not in a poetic sense. For this it is not always convenient to
employ the whole of the frog. The heart is therefore cut out, and
make the subject of experiments, as to what conditions
accelerate, and what retard, the rate and amplitude of its beat.
When thus isolated, the heart tends of itself to come to a
standstill, but if, by means of fine tubing, it be then subjected
to interval blood pressure, its beating will be resumed, and will
continue uninterrupted for a long time. By the influence of
warmth, the frequency of the pulsation may be increased, but its
amplitude diminished. Exactly the reverse is the effect of cold.
The natural rhythm and the amplitude of the pulse undergo
appropriate changes, again, under the action of different drugs.
Under either, the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_097" id=
"Page_097">[Pg_097]</a></span>heart may come to a standstill, but
on blowing this off the beat is renewed. The action of chloroform
is more dangerous, any excess in the dose inducing permanent
arrest. Besides these, there are poisons also which arrest the
heart beat, and a very noticeable fact in this connection is,
that some stop in a contracted, and others in a relaxed
condition. Knowing these opposed effects, it is sometimes
possible to counteract the effect of one poison by administering
another.</p>
<p class="indent">I have thus briefly stated some of the most
important phenomena in connection with spontaneous movements in
animal tissues. Is it possible that in plants also any parallel
phenomena might be observed? In answer to this question, I may
say that I have found numerous instances of automatic movements
in plants.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
RHYTHMIC PULSATIONS IN DESMODIUM</p>
<p class="indent">The existence of such spontaneous movements can
easily be demonstrated, by means of our Indian <i>Bon charal</i>,
the telegraph plant, or Desmodium gyrans, whose small leaflets
dance continually. The popular belief that they dance in response
to the clapping of the hands is quite untrue. From readings of
the scripts made by this plant, I am in a position to state that
the automatic movements of both plants and animals are guided by
laws which are identical.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_098" id=
"Page_098">[Pg_098]</a></span>Firstly, when, for convenience of
experiment, we cut off the leaflet, its spontaneous movements,
like those of the heart, come to a stop. But if we now subject
the isolated leaflet, by means of a fine tube, to an added
internal pressure of the plant's sap, its pulsations are renewed,
and continue uninterrupted for a very long time. It is found
again that the pulsation frequency is increased under the action
warmth, and lessened under cold, increased frequency being
attended by diminution of amplitude and <i>vice versa</i>. Under
either, there is temporary arrest, revival being possible when
the vapour is blown off. More fatal is the effect of chloroform.
The most extraordinary parallelism, however, lies in the fact
that those poisons which arrest the beat of the heart in a
particular way, arrest the plant&mdash;pulsation also in a
corresponding manner. I have thus been able to revive a leaflet
poisoned by the application of one, with a dose of a
counteracting poison.</p>
<p class="indent">Let us now enquire into the causes of these
automatic movements so-called. In experimenting with certain
types of plant-tissues, I find that an external stimulus may not
always evoke an immediate reply. What happens, then, to the
incident energy? It is not really lost, for these particular
plant-tissues have the power of shortage. In this way, energy
derived in various ways from without&mdash;as light, <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_099" id=
"Page_099">[Pg_099]</a></span>warmth, food, and so on&mdash;is
constantly being accumulated, when a certain point is reached,
there is an overflow, and we call this overflow spontaneous
movement. Thus what we call automatic is really an overflow of
what has previously been stored up. When this accumulated energy
is exhausted, then there is also an end of spontaneous movements.
By abstracting its stored-up heat&mdash;through the application
of cold water&mdash;we can bring to a stop the automatic
pulsations of Desmodium. But on allowing a first accession of
heat from outside, these pulsations are gradually restored.</p>
<p class="indent">In the matter of these so-called spontaneous
activities of the plant, I find that there are two distinct
types. In one, the overflow is initiated with very little
storage, but here the unusual display of activity soon comes to a
stop. To maintain such specimens in the rhythmic condition,
constant stimulation from outside is necessary. Plants of this
type are extremely dependent on outside influences, and when such
sources of stimulus are removed, they speedily come to an
inglorious stop. <i>Kamranga</i> or <i>Averrhoa</i> is an example
of this kind. In the second type of automatic plant activity I
find that long continued storage is required, before an overflow
can begin. But in this case, the spontaneous outburst is
persistent and of long duration, even when the plant is deprived
of any immediately <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id=
"Page_100">[Pg_100]</a></span>exciting cause. These, therefore,
are not so obviously dependent as the others on the sunshine of
the world. Our telegraph-plant, <i>Desmodium</i> or <i>Bon
charal</i>, is an example of this.</p>
<p class="indent">It appears to me that we have here a suggestive
parallel to certain phenomena with which this audience will
surely prove more familiar than I, namely, the facts of literary
inspiration. For the attainment of this exalted condition, also,
is it not necessary to have previous storage, with a consequent
bubbling overflow? Certain indications incline me to suspect that
perhaps in this also we have an example of so-called spontaneity,
or automatic responsiveness. If this be so, aspirants, to the
condition might well be asked to decide in whose footsteps they
will choose to tread&mdash;those of <i>Kamranga</i>, with its
dependence on outside influences, and inevitably ephemeral
activity, or those of <i>Bon charal</i>, with its characteristic
of patient long enduring accumulation of forces, to find
uninterrupted and sustained expression.</p>

THE PLANT'S RESPONSE TO THE SHOCK OF DEATH</p>
<p class="indent">A time comes when, after one answer to a
supreme shock, there is a sudden end of the plant's power to give
any response. This supreme shock is the shock of death. Even in
this crisis, there is no immediate <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg_101]</a></span>change in the placid
appearance of the plant. Drooping and withering are events that
occur long after death itself. How does the plant then, give this
last answer? In man, at the critical moment, a spasm passes
through the whole body, and similarly in the plant, I find that a
great contractile spasm takes place. This is accompanied by an
electrical spasm also. In the script of the Morograph, or Death
recorder, the line that up to this point was being drawn, becomes
suddenly reversed, and then ends. This is the last answer of the
plant.</p>
<p class="indent">These are mute companions, silently, growing
beside our door, have now told us the tale of their
life-tremulousness and their death spasm, in script that is as
inarticulate as they. May it not be said that this their story
has a pathos of its own, beyond any that the poets have
conceived?</p>

PROF. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id=

<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 1.0em">
MARVELS OF PLANT LIFE</p>
<p class="indent">On the 8th June 1912, Dr J. C. Bose, who had
gone to Advaita Ashrama, Mayavati, on a holiday trip, gave an
illuminating discourse on the marvels of plant life.</p>
<p class="indent">He began by stating that a stimulus takes a
certain time before it gets a response. This stimulus may be of
different forms, <i>e.g.</i>, it may be a sound stimulus, a light
stimulus, an electric stimulus, and so on. The feebler the
stimulus, the greater is the time it takes to elicit the
response. For instance if one is called by a distant voice, one
doubts whether he has been called at all, but in the case of a
piercing scream, he starts up at once.</p>
<p class="indent">Now, the difficulty is
that when the stimulus, the blow, is so strong as to get an
instantaneous response, how is one to measure this infinitesimal
time between the blow and the response? And this must be done
absolutely free from any personal interference, so as to ensure
correct results.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id=
"Page_103">[Pg_103]</a></span>Dr. Bose here described how after
deep thought and careful experiments and researches of several
years he invented and manufactured a highly sensitive instrument
which could automatically record the "response time" of a plant
even to one thousandth part of a second. And in order to convey a
graphic idea of the principles under which it worked, he had even
made by means of a few simple things a crude form of his
instrument, which helped the audience to form a clear idea of how
a shock given to a plant which was experimented upon, would be
recorded automatically by the apparatus by means of dots on its
writing pad, and also how to ascertain the exact time each plant
took to respond to the stimulus received. Thus the plant now
records its own history unerringly by its own hand as it were.
And that the <i>same</i> results are obtained each time the
experiment is repeated under similar conditions, shows that this
recording of the response time is a scientific phenomenon.</p>
<p class="indent">As an example of the similarities of reactions
in plant and animal, Prof. Bose described the rhythmic activities
of certain plants, in which automatic pulsations are maintained
as in the animal heart. This phenomenon is exemplified by the
Telegraph plant, which grows wild in the Gangetic plane; its
Indian name is <i>Bon charal</i> or 'forest churl', the popular
belief being that it dances to the clapping <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg_104]</a></span>of
the hand. There is no foundation however for this belief. It is a
papilionaceous plant with trifoliate leaves, of which the
terminal leaflet is large, and the two lateral, very small. Each
of these is inserted on the petiole by means of pulvinule. The
lateral leaflets are seen to execute pulsating movements which
are apparently uncaused, and are not unlike the rhythmic movement
of the heart to which we shall see later that their resemblance
is more than superficial.</p>
<p class="indent">In the intact plant, under favourable
conditions, these movements are easily observed to take place
more or less continuously; but there are times when they come to
a standstill. For this reason and because of the fact that a
large plant cannot easily be manipulated as a whole and subjected
to various changing conditions which the purpose of the
investigation demands, it is desirable, if possible, to
experiment with the detached petiole, carrying the pulsating
leaflet. The required amputation however may be followed by
arrest of the pulsating movements. But, as in the case of the
isolated heart in a state of standstill, Dr. Bose found that the
movement of the leaflet can be renewed, in the detached specimen,
by the application of the internal hydrostatic pressure. Under
these conditions, the rhythmic pulsations are easily maintained
uniform for several hours. This is a great advantage,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id=
"Page_105">[Pg_105]</a></span>in as much as in the undetached
specimen, the pulsations are not usually found to be so regular
as they now become. So small a specimen, again, can easily be
subjected to changing experimental conditions, such as the
variation of internal hydrostatic pressure and temperature,
application of different drugs, vapours and gases.</p>
<p class="indent">Under varying conditions the same plant has
been observed to take different response times, as for instance,
less in heat than in cold, less in summer than in winter, less in
the morning than in the evening, and so forth. Again, different
plants have different response times.</p>
<p class="indent">It is a remarkable fact that the mimosa is ten
times as sensitive as a frog in giving the response. And the
native idea that plants are of a lower order than animal life
will cost many a sad disappointment.</p>
<p class="indent">In the course of his lecture Dr. Bose spoke of
some of his startling discoveries recently made.... The lecturer
gave quite a spiritual turn to his discourse as he finished it
with the remark that, as it has been the earnest endeavour of
scientists to minimise material friction in order to get the best
results, so in our human concerns, it should be our best aim to
minimise friction,&mdash;which is, Ignorance.</p>

<p class="indent">Professor Bose has been long engaged in
researches on the "Irritability of Plants," with results of great
interest. These results have been made possible by the invention
of a series of instruments of extraordinary precision and
delicacy. Some of Professor Bose's instruments measure and record
a thousandth of a second. Invisible movements in plants, hitherto
beyond human scrutiny, have been brought within the range of
immediate perception through the wonderful devices shown by the

<p class="indent">His Excellency, as President, called upon Dr.
Bose to deliver his lecture.</p>
<p class="indent">Professor Bose commenced with a reference to
the claims made by those who profess to discriminate character by
handwriting. As to the authenticity of such claims, scepticism
was permissible; but there was no doubt that one's handwriting
might be modified profoundly by conditions, physical and mental.
There still existed, at Hatfield House, documents which contained
the signature of the historical Guy Fawkes. A photograph
projected on the screen showed a sinister variation in those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id=
"Page_108">[Pg_108]</a></span>signatures. The crabbed and
distorted characters of the last words which Guy Fawkes wrote on
earth told their own tale of that fateful night. Such was the
tale that might be unfolded by the lines and curves of a human
autograph. Could plants be made similarly to write their own
autographs revealing their hidden story? Storm and sunshine, the
warmth of summer and the frost of winter, drought and rain, would
come and go about the plants. What subtle impress did they leave
behind? How were the invisible, internal changes to be made
externally visible?</p>
<p style=

AUTOMATIC RECORDERS</p>
<p class="indent">The lecturer had succeeded in devising experimental methods and apparatus by
which the plant was made to give an answering signal, which was
then automatically recorded into an intelligible script. The
results of the new investigations were so novel that Professor
Bose spent several years in perfecting automatic instruments
which completely eliminated all personal equations. The plant
attached to the recording apparatus was automatically excited by
a stimulus absolutely constant, making its own responsive
records, going through its period of recovery, and embarking on
the same cycle over again without assistance at any point
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id=
"Page_109">[Pg_109]</a></span>from the observer. The most
sensitive organ for perception of a stimulus was the human
tongue. An average European could by his tongue detect an
electrical current as feeble as six micro-amperes, a micro-ampere
being a millionth part of a unit of electrical current. Professor
Bose found that his Hindu peoples could detect a much feebler
current, namely, 1.5 micro-amperes. It was an open question
whether such a high excitability of the tongue was to be claimed
as a distinct advantage. But the fact might explain the eminence
of his countrymen in forensic domains! (Laughter.) The plant,
when tested, was found to be ten times more sensitive than a
human being.</p>

EFFECT OF FOOD AND DRUGS</p>
<p class="indent">It was shown that when the plant had a surfeit
of drink, it became excessively lethargic and irresponsive. By
extracting fluid from the gorged plant, its motor activity was at
once re-established. Under alcohol its responsive script became
ludicrously unsteady. A scientific superstition existed regarding
carbonic acid as being good for a plant. But Professor Bose's
experiments showed distinctly that the gas would suffocate the
plant as readily as it did the animal. Only in the presence of
sunlight could the effect be modified by secondary reaction.</p>

AUTOMATISM <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id=

<p class="indent">It was impossible in a limited space, said
Professor Bose, to do more than mention the numerous other
remarkable experiments which riveted the
attention of the audience. By means of apparatus specially
devised, pulsative plants were made to record their rhythmic
throbbings. It was shown that the pulse beats of the plants were
affected by the action of various drugs, and divers stimuli, in a
manner similar to that of the animal heart. Perhaps the most
weird experience was to watch the death-struggle of a plant under
the action of poison. Turning from death to its antithesis life
and growth, the audience were shown how the latter was made
visible by means of the appliances invented by Professor Bose.
The infinitesimal growth of a plant became highly magnified in
the experiment.</p>

RESEARCHES AT PRESIDENCY COLLEGE</p>
<p class="indent">When the lecturer commenced his investigations,
original research in India was regarded as an impossibility. No
proper laboratory existed, nor was there any scientific
manufactory for the construction of a special apparatus. In spite
of these difficulties it had been a matter of gratification to
the lecturer that the various investigations already carried out
at the Presidency College had done something for the advancement
of knowledge. The <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id=
"Page_111">[Pg_111]</a></span>delicate instruments seen in
operation at the lecture, which had been regarded with admiration
by many distinguished scientific men in the West, were all
constructed at the College workshops by Indian mechanics.</p>
<p class="indent">It was also with pride that the lecturer
referred to the co-operation of his pupils and assistants,
through whose help the extensive works, requiring ceaseless
labour by day and night, had been accomplished. Doubt had been
cast on the capacity of Indian students in the field of science.
From his personal experience Professor Bose bore testimony to
their special fitness in this respect. An intellectual hunger had
been created by the spread of education. An Indian student
demanded something absorbing to think about and to give scope for
his latent energies. If this could be done, he would betake
himself ardently to research into Nature, which could never end.
There was room for such toilers who by incessant work would
extend the bounds of human knowledge.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
FROM PLANT TO ANIMAL LIFE</p>
<p class="indent">Before concluding the lecturer dwelt on the
fact that all the varied and complex responses of the animal had
been foreshadowed in the plant. The phenomena of life in the
plant were thus not so remote as had been hitherto supposed. The
plant <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id=
"Page_112">[Pg_112]</a></span>world, like the animal, was a
thrill and a throb with responsiveness to all the stimuli which
fell upon it. Thus, community throughout the great ocean of life,
in all its different forms, outweighed apparent dissimilarity.
Diversity was swallowed up in unity.</p>

<p class="indent">A most instructive and interesting lecture was
delivered on Thursday, the 30th Jaunuary,
1913, at the Calcutta University Institute Hall, by Dr. J. C.
Bose, on the above subject. It was illustrated with experiments
and in spite of the technical nature of the subject, the manner
of treatment made the discourse extremely palatable and easy of
apprehension to the lay understanding and intelligence. The
truths of science could seldom be exposed so light-heartedly and
in language leavened with balmy humour. The lecture was very
largely attended by ladies and gentlemen, European and Indian,
representing the light and leading of the city. The chair was
taken by Mr. W. R. Gourlay. Amongst those present we noticed the
Hon. Mr. Ramsay McDonald, Mr. Justice Harington, Mr. Justice
Chaudhuri, Hon'ble Mr. Gokhale, Hon'ble Mr. Lyon, Hon'ble Mr. D.
N. Sarvadhikari, Sir Gurudas Banerji, Hon'ble Mr. Apcar and Dr.
Chuni Lal Bose Rai Bahadur.</p>
<p class="indent">The Chairman, in a few well chosen words
introduced the lecturer.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id=
"Page_114">[Pg_114]</a></span>Professor Bose in going to deliver
his highly interesting lecture first showed how on account of the
imperfection of our senses we fail to detect various forces which
play around us. We are not only deaf, but practically blind.
While we perceive eleven octaves of sound, we can see only a
single octave of other vibration which is called light. In order
to detect the invisible light a special detector
has to be devised. Prof. Bose showed his artificial
retina previously exhibited at the Royal Institution which not
only detected luminous radiation but also invisible lights in the
intra red and ultra violet regions. In the course of his remarks
illustrating the nature of electric or Hertzian waves, which gave
rise to the invisible radiation he proceeded to enumerate some of
the conditions necessary for experimenting with them, and to
describe the apparatus he had invented for the purpose. Hertz had
used waves which were about 10 metres in length. It was
impossible to attempt any quantitative measurement of their
optical properties on account of large waves curling round
corners. The lecturer had succeeded in producing the shortest
waves, with frequency of 50,000 millions of vibrations per
second, the particular invisible radiation being only thirteen
octaves below visible light. His generator produced the small
sharp beam which alone could be employed for quantitative
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id=
"Page_115">[Pg_115]</a></span>measurements. By means of this
apparatus experiments on electric radiation could be carried on
with as much certainty as could experiments with ordinary light.
Prof. Bose then performed experiments illustrative of the
properties possessed in common by light waves and electric waves.
He exhibited the power of selective absorption to electric rays
displayed by many substances pointing out that while water
stopped them, pitch, coal tar, and others were quite transparent
to them. He showed how the rays were reflected by mirrors,
obeying the same laws as light. The hand of the experimenter was
found to be a good reflector, the rays rebounding after impact.
Electric rays also undergo refraction and he described an
ingenious method he had devised by which the index of refraction
of numerous opaque substances could be obtained with the highest
exactitude. In conclusion he gave an account of his discovery of
the polarisation of electric rays by crystals. He showed that
these polarised the electric rays just as they did ordinary
light. He further proved that substances under pressure and
strain could produce double refraction in them, as did glass
under the same conditions in light. Tourmaline was useless for
electric rays; but a lock of human hair was extraordinarily
efficient. According to this theoretical prediction, an ordinary
book was shown to exhibit <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg_116]</a></span>selective absorption
in a striking manner. Thus while the Calcutta University Calendar
was, usually, very opaque, it became quite transparent when held
in a particular direction as regards the impinging ray.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Gourlay observed that the lecture opened
out to himself, as well as to other vistas, which they had never
dreamt of before.</p>

LECTURE ON ELECTRIC RADIATION</p>
<p class="indent">A crowded assembly met at the University Hall,
on the 22nd February, 1913, to hear the first of Prof. Bose's
discourses before the University of Lahore.</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. Bose opened his address by alluding to the
historic journey of Jivaka, who afterwards became the physician
of Buddha, making his way from Bengal to the University of
Taxila, in quest of knowledge.
Twenty-five centuries had gone by and there was before them
another pilgrim who had journeyed the same distance to bring, as
an offering what he had gathered in the domain of knowledge.</p>
<p class="indent">The lecturer called attention to the fact that
knowledge was never the exclusive possession of any particular
race nor did it ever recognise geograpahical geographical limitations. The whole world was interdependent,
and a constant interchange of thought had been carried on
throughout the ages enriching the common heritage of mankind.
Hellenistic Greeks and Eastern Aryans had met here in Taxila to
exchange the best each had to offer. <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id=
"Page_118">[Pg_118]</a></span>After many centuries the East and
West had met once more, and it would be the test of the real
greatness of the two civilisations that both should be finer and
better for the shock of contact. The apparent dormancy of
intellectual life in India had been only a temporary phase. Just
like the oscillations of the seasons found the globe, great
pulsations of intellectual activity pass over the different
peoples of the earth.</p>
<p class="indent">With the coming of the spring the dormant life
springs forth; similarly the life that India conserves, by
inheritance, culture and temperament, was only latent and was
again ready to spring forth into the blossom and fruit of
knowledge. Although science was neither of the East nor of the
West, but international in its universality, certain aspect of it
gained richness of colour by reason of their place of origin.
India, perhaps through its habit of synthesis, was apt to realise
instinctively the idea of unity and to see in the phenomenal
world an universe instead of a multiverse. It was this tendency,
the lecturer thought, which had led Indian physicist, like
himself, when studying the effect of forces on matter to find
boundary lines vanishing, and to see points of contact emerge
between the realms of the living and non-living. In taking up the
subject of the evening's discourse on electric radiation of
Hertzian waves, the lecturer explained
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id=
"Page_119">[Pg_119]</a></span>the constitution of the apparatus
which he had devised for an exhaustive study of the properties of
electric waves. His apparatus permitted experiments with the
electric rays to be carried on with as much certainty as
experiments with ordinary light, and he demonstrated the identity
of electric radiation and light. The electric rays are reflected
from plane and curved mirrors in the same way and subject to the
same laws. Electric rays, like rays of light are refracted. Like
race of light too, electric waves can be selectively stopped by
various substances, which are "electrically" coloured. Water
which is a conductor of electricity stops the electric ray; where
as liquid air which is a non-conductor is quite transparent to
the rays.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally Professor Bose explained his discovery
of Polarisation of these rays by various crystals. Tourmaline,
which was a good polariser for ordinary light, was not so
effective. The lecturer discovered that the crystal Nemalite
possessed the power of polarising the
electric rays in the most perfect manner. Professor Bose also
explained how the internal constitution of an opaque mass was
revealed by the help of light which was itself invisible.</p>
<p class="indent">The lecturer concluded his discourse by drawing
attention to the limitations of human perception. Man's power of
hearing was confirmed to eleven octaves of sound notes.
In the case of vision the <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id=
"Page_120">[Pg_120]</a></span>limitation was far more serious,
his power of sight extending only through a single octave of
those ether waves which constituted light. These ether vibrations
of various frequencies could be maintained by electrical means.
By pressing the stop button of the apparatus which was exhibited,
ether vibrations, 50,000 millions per second, were produced. A
second stop gave rise to a different vibration. Let his audience
imagine a large electric organ provided with an infinite number
of stops, each stop giving rise to a particular ether note. Let
the lowest stop produce one vibration a second. They should then
get a gigantic wave of 186,000 miles long. Let the next stop give
rise to two vibrations in a second, and let each succeeding stop
produce higher and higher notes. Let them imagine an unseen hand
pressing the different stops in rapid succession, producing
higher and higher notes. The ether note would thus rise in
frequency from one vibration in a second, to tens, to hundreds,
to thousands, to hundreds of thousands, to millions, to millions
of millions! While the ethereal sea in which they were all
immersed were being thus agitated by these multitudinous waves,
they would remain entirely unaffected, for they possessed no
organs of perception, to respond to these waves.</p>
<p class="indent">As the ether note rose still higher in pitch,
they would for a brief moment perceive a sensation of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id=
"Page_121">[Pg_121]</a></span>warmth. This would be the case when
the ether vibration reached a frequency of several billions of
times in a second. As the note rose still higher, their eyes
would begin to be affected, a red glimmer of light being the
first to make its appearance. From this point the few visible
colours would be comprised within a single octave of
vibration&mdash;from 400 to 800 billions in one second. As the
frequency of vibration rose still higher their organs of
perception would fail them completely; a great gap in their
consciousness would obliterate the rest. The brief flash of light
would be succeeded by unbroken darkness. How circumscribed was
their knowledge? In reality they stood in the midst of a luminous
ocean almost blind! The little they could see was as nothing
compared to the vastness of that which they could not. But it may
be said that, out of the very imperfection of his senses, man has
been able, in science, to build for himself a raft of thought by
which to make daring adventure on the great seas of the
unknown.</p>

PLANT RESPONSE</p>
<p class="indent">In his third lecture delivered, on the 25th
February 1913, at the Punjab University Hall, Dr. Bose of
Calcutta dealt with "Plant Response." He said:&mdash;</p>
<p class="indent">In strong contrast to the energetic animal,
with its various reflex movements and pulsating organs, stands
the plant, in its apparent placidity and immobility. Yet that
same environment which with its changing influences affects the
animal is playing upon it also. Storm and sunshine, the warmth of
summer and the frost of winter, drought and rain, all these come
and go about it. What coercion do they exercise upon it? What
subtle impress do they leave behind? These internal changes are
entirely beyond our visual scrutiny. Is it possible in any way to
have these revealed to us? Dr. Bose had shown the possibility of
this by detecting and measuring the actual response of the
organism to a questioning shock. In an excitable condition the
feeblest stimulus should evoke in the plant an extraordinarily large reply in a depressed state
even <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id=
"Page_123">[Pg_123]</a></span>a strong stimulus would only call
forth a feeble response; and lastly, when death overcome life,
there would be an abrupt end of the power to answer to all. By
the invention of different types of apparatus, the lecturer had
succeeded in making the plant itself write an answering script to
a testing stimulus. Scripts could also be obtained of the plant's
spontaneous movements; and a recording arm demarcated the line of
life from that of death.</p>
<p class="indent">In taking the self-made records made by the
plant it was found that after the prolonged inactivity of a cold
night the plant was apt to be lethargic, and its first answers
indistinct. But as blow after blow was delivered, the lethargy
passed off, and the replies became stronger and
stronger. After the fatigue of the day, the state of things was
reversed. The plant became very lethargic after excessive
absorption of food; but the normal activity might be restored by
artificial removal of the excess. The effect of alcohol and of
various narcotics were clearly followed in the modification of
the automatic record made by the plant.</p>
<p class="indent">A prevailing scientific error had overcome in
life, there would be an abrupt end regarding a certain class of
plants to be alone sensitive. The lecturer showed by certain
remarkable experiments that all plants and all organs of plants
were sensitive.</p>
<p class="indent">In certain animal tissues, a very curious
phenomenon <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id=
"Page_124">[Pg_124]</a></span>was observed. In man and other
animals there were tissues which beat spontaneously. As long as
life lasted, so long did the heart continue to pulsate. There
could be no effect without a cause. How then was it that these
pulsations became spontaneous? To this query, no satisfactory
answer had been forthcoming. Similar spontaneous movements were
also observable in plant tissues, and by their investigation the
secret of automatism in the animal world became unravelled. The
existence of these spontaneous movements could easily be
demonstrated by means of the Indian "Bon Charal", the telegraph
plant, whose small leaflets danced continuously up and down. The
popular belief that they danced in response to the clappings of
the hand was quite erroneous. From the readings of the scripts
made by this plant, the lecturer was in a position to state that
the automatic movements of both plants and animals were guided by
laws which were identical. Thus in the rhythmic tissues of the
plant and the animal the pulsation frequency was increased under
the action of warmth and lessened under cold, increased frequency
being attended by diminution of amplitude, and "<i>vice versa</i>". Under ether, there was a
temporary arrest, revival being possible when the vapour was
blown off. More fatal was the effect of chloroform. The most extraordinary parallelism, however, lay in
the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id=
"Page_125">[Pg_125]</a></span>fact that those poisons which
arrested the beat of the heart in a particular way arrested the
plant pulsation in a corresponding manner. The lecturer had
succeeded in reviving a leaflet poisoned by the application of
one with a dose of counteracting poison.</p>
<p class="indent">A time came when after one answer to a supreme
shock there was a sudden end of the plant's power to give any
response. This supreme shock was the shock of death. Even in this
crisis, there was no immediate change in the placid appearance of
the plant. In man at the critical moment, a spasm passed through
the whole body, and similarly in the plant the lecturer had
discovered that a great contractile spasm took place. This was
accompanied by an electrical spasm also. In the script of the
death recorder the line that up to this point was being drawn
became suddenly reversed, and then ended. This was the last
answer of the plants.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus the responsiveness of the plant world was
one. There was no difference of any kind between sunshine plants,
and those which had hitherto been regarded as insensitive or
ordinary. It had also been shown that all the varied and complex
responses of the animal were foreshadowed in the plant. An
impressive spectacle was thus revealed of that vast unity in
which all living organisms, from the simplest plant to the
highest animal, were linked together and made one.</p>

WRITTEN STATEMENT RELATING TO THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT</p>
<p class="indent">83, 627 (I) <i>Method of
recruitment.</i>&mdash;The first question on which I have been
asked to give my opinion is as regards the method of recruitment.
I think that a high standard of scholarship should be the only
qualification insisted on. Graduates of well-known Universities,
distinguished for a particular line of study, should be given the
preference. I think the prospects of the Indian Educational
Service are <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id=
"Page_127">[Pg_127]</a></span>sufficiently high to attract the
very best material. In colonial Universities they manage to get
very distinguished men without any extravagantly high pay.
Possibly the present departmental method of election does not
admit of sufficiently wide publicity of notice to attract the
best candidates.</p>
<p class="indent">83, 628 (II) <i>System of training and
probation.</i>&mdash;As regards probation and training,
Educational officers should first win a reputation as good
teachers before the appointment is confirmed as they are
transferred to important colleges.</p>
<p class="indent">83, 629 (IV) <i>Conditions of
Salary.</i>&mdash;As regards conditions of Salary, the pay should
be moderately high, but not extravagant, and settled once for all
under some simple and well-defined rules. It is not only very
humiliating but degrading to a true scholar to be scrambling for
money. The difference between the pay of the higher and lower
services should be minimised.</p>
<p class="indent">83, 630 (VI) <i>Conditions of
pension.</i>&mdash;With reference to pension, I think it is very
unfair that more favourable terms are offered, when the pensioner
elects to retire in England.</p>
<p class="indent">83, 631 (VII) <i>Such limitations as exist in
the employment of non-Europeans.</i>&mdash;Passing on to the
question of limitations that exist in the employment of Indians
in the higher service, I should like to give expression to an
injustice which is very keenly felt. It is <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id=
"Page_128">[Pg_128]</a></span>unfortunate that Indian graduates
of European Universities who have distinguished themselves in a
remarkable manner do not for one reason or other find facilities
for entering the higher Educational Service.</p>
<p class="indent">As teachers and workers it is an incontestable
fact that Indian officers have distinguished themselves very
highly, and anything which discriminates between Europeans and
Indians in the way of pay and prospects is most undesirable. A
sense of injustice is ill-calculated to bring about that harmony
which is so necessary among all the members of an educational
institution, professors and students alike.</p>
<p class="indent">83, 632 (VIII) <i>Relations of the service with
the Indian Civil Service and with other services.</i>&mdash;As
regards the relations with the Indian Civil Service, I am under
the impression that they are somewhat strained, but of this I
have no personal experience.</p>
<p class="indent">83, 633 (IX) <i>Other points.</i>&mdash;I have
endeavoured to give my opinion on the definite questions which
have been asked. There is another aspect of educational work in
India which I think of the highest importance, though I am not
exactly sure whether it falls within the terms of reference to
the Royal Commission. I think that all the machinery to improve
the higher education in India would be altogether ineffectual
unless India enters the world <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg_129]</a></span>movement for the
advancement of knowledge. And for this it is absolutely necessary
to touch the imagination of the people so as to rouse them to
give their best energies to the work of research and discovery,
in which all the nations of the world are now engaged. To aim at
anything less will only end in a lifeless and mechanical system
from which the soul of reality has passed away. On this subject I
could have said much, but I will confine myself to one point
which I think at the present juncture to be of importance. The
Government of Bengal has been foremost in a tentative way in
encouraging research. What is necessary is the extension and
continuity of this enlightened policy.</p>
<p class="indent">83, 634. <i>Supplementary Note.</i>&mdash;I
would like to add a few remarks to make the meaning of paragraphs
83, 627 and 83, 631 in my note more explicit.</p>
<p class="indent">At the present recruitment in the Indian
Educational Service is made in England and is practically
confined to Englishmen. Such racial preference is in my opinion,
prejudicial to the interest of education. The best man available,
English or Indian should be selected impartially, and high
scholarship should be the only test.</p>
<p class="indent">It has been said that the present standard of
Indian Universities is not as high as that of British
Universities, and that the work done by the former is more like
that of a sixth form of public schools in <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id=
"Page_130">[Pg_130]</a></span>England. It is therefore urged that
what is required for an Educational officer is the capacity to
manage classes rather than high scholarship. I do not agree with
these views: (1) there are Universities in Great Britain whose
standards are not higher than ours; I do not think that the Pass
Degree even of Oxford or Cambridge is higher than the
corresponding degree here; (2) the standard of the Indian
Universities is being steadily raised; (3) the standard will
depend upon what the men entrusted with Educational work will
make it. For these reasons it is necessary that the level of
scholarship represented by the Indian Educational Service should
be maintained very high.</p>
<p class="indent">In paragraph 83,631 I have stated that even
these Indians who have distinguished themselves in European
Universities have little chance of entering the higher
Educational Service. I should like to add that these highly
qualified Indians need only opportunities to render service which
would greatly advance the cause of higher education. As regards
graduates of Indian Universities, I have known men among them
whose works have been highly appreciated. If promising Indian
graduates are given the opportunity of visiting foreign
Universities, I have no doubt that they would stand comparison
with the best recruits that can be obtained from the West.</p>

DR. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id=
"Page_131">[Pg_131]</a></span>J. C. BOSE CALLED AND EXAMINED</p>
<p class="indent">83,635. (Chairman). The witness favoured an
arrangement by which Indians would enter the higher ranks of the
service, either through the Provincial Service or by direct
recruitment in India. The latter class of officers, after
completing their education in India, should ordinarily go to
Europe with a view to widening their experience. By this he did
not wish to decry the training given in the Indian Universities,
which produced some of the very best men, and he would not make
the rule absolute. It was not necessary for men of exceptional
ability to go to England in order to occupy a high chair.
Unfortunately, on account of there being no openings for men of
genius in the Educational Service, distinguished men were driven
to the profession of Law. In the present condition of India a
larger number of distinguished men were needed to give their
lives to the education of the people.</p>
<p class="indent">83,636. The witness himself had spent part of
his career in Europe, and looking back he could say that this had
been of great profit to him, not so much on account of the
training he got, as by being brought into personal contact with
eminent men whose influence extorted his admiration, and create
in him a feeling of emulation. In this way he owed a great deal
to Lord Rayleigh under whom he <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg_132]</a></span>worked, but he did
not see why that advantage should not eventually be secured by
Indians in India under an Indian Lord Rayleigh.</p>
<p class="indent">83,637. There should be only one Educational
Service, but men who were distinguished in any subject should not
start from its very lowest rung but should be placed somewhere in
the middle of it.</p>
<p class="indent">83,638. There were men in the Provincial
Service who were very distinguished; it was all a question of
genius. The Educational Service ought to be regarded not as a
profession, but as a calling. Some men were born to be teachers.
It was not a question of race, of course; in order to have an
efficient educational system, there must be an efficient
organisation, but this should not be allowed to become
fossilised, and thus stand in the way of healthy growth.</p>
<p class="indent">83,639. In the Presidency College a young man
fresh from an English university was at once appointed a
Professor regardless of his lack of experience, whereas an Indian
who passed in highest examination with honours in India was
appointed as an Assistant Professor. This grounding often made
him more efficient as a teacher than the Professor recruited from
England. There were now several Professors in the college, in the
Provincial Service, who were highly qualified, and who lectured
to the highest classes with very great success.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id=
"Page_133">[Pg_133]</a></span>83,640. In the Physics Department
he had under his direction several Assistants who were so well
qualified that they were allowed to give lectures to several
classes. These Assistants, after their experience at the
Presidency College, would be best fitted to become Professors in
the mofussil at Colleges. He would like to see them promoted to
the higher service after they had had experience. But before he
gave them the highest positions, he would make it compulsory for
them to go to Europe.</p>
<p class="indent">83,641. A proportion of Europeans in the
service was needed, but only as experts and not as ordinary
teachers. Only the very best men should be obtained from Europe,
and for exceptional cases. The general educational work should be
done entirely by Indians, who understood the difficulties of the
country much better than any outsider.</p>
<p class="indent">83,642. He advocated the direct recruitment of
Indians in India by the local government in consultation with the
Secretary of State, rather than by the Secretary of State alone.
Indians were under a great difficulty, in that they could not
remain indefinitely in England after taking their degrees and
being away from the place of recruitment their claims were
overlooked.</p>
<p class="indent">83,643. There was no reason why a European
should be paid a higher rate of salary than an Indian on account
of the distance he came. An <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg_134]</a></span>Indian felt a sense
of inferiority if a difference was made as regards pay. The very
slight saving which government made by differentiating between
the two did not compensate for the feeling of wrong done. This
feeling would remain even if the pay was the same, but an
additional grant in the shape of a foreign service allowance was
made to Europeans. All workers in the field of education should
feel a sense of solidarity, because they were all serving one
great cause, namely, education.</p>
<p class="indent">83,644. The term "professor", as at present
used in India, was undoubtedly a comprehensive one, but it was
equally comprehensive in the West.</p>
<p class="indent">83,645. (Sir Murray Hammick). The witness did
not wish to recruit definite proportions of the service in
England and in India respectively. He would for various reasons
prefer a large number of Indians engaged in education.</p>
<p class="indent">83,646. Even in Calcutta he would not make any
difference between the pay of the Indian and the pay of the
European.</p>
<p class="indent">83,647. (Sir Valentine Chirol). The witness
attached great value to the influence of the teacher upon the
student in the earlier stages of his education, and it was in
these stages that that influence could best be exercised. At the
same time he desired to limit the appointment of non-Indians to
men of very great distinction.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id=
"Page_135">[Pg_135]</a></span>83,648. If a foreign professor
would not come and serve in India for the same remuneration as he
obtained in his own country, the witness would certainly not
force him to come.</p>
<p class="indent">83,649. (Mr. Abdur Rahim). Recruitment for the
Educational Service should be made in the first place in India,
if suitable men were available; but if not then he would allow
the best outsiders to be brought in. In the present state of the
country it would be very easy to fill up many of the chairs by
selecting the best men in India.</p>
<p class="indent">83,650. The aim of the universities should be
to promote two classes of work&mdash;first, research;
and secondly, an all-round sound education. Men of
different types would be required for these two duties.</p>
<p class="indent">83,651. (Mr. Madge). Any idea that the
educational system of India was so far inferior to that of
England, that Indians, who had made their mark, had done so, not
because of the educational system of the country, but in spite of
it, was quite unfounded. The standard of education prevailing in
India was quite up to the mark of several British universities.
It was as true of any other country in the world as of India that
education was valued as a means for passing examinations, and not
only for itself, and there was no more cramming in India than
elsewhere.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id=
"Page_136">[Pg_136]</a></span>83,652. The West certainly brought
to the East a modern spirit, which was very valuable, but it
would be dearly purchased by the loss of an honorable career for
competent Indians in their own country.</p>
<p class="indent">83,653. The educational system in India had in
the past been too mechanical, but a turn for the better was now
taking place and the universities were recognising the importance
of research work, and were willing to give their highest degrees
to encourage it.</p>
<p class="indent">83,654. (Mr. Macdonald). The witness did not
think it was necessary to have a non-Indian element in the
service in order to stiffen it up, but he accepted the principle
that there should be a certain small proportion of
non-Indians.</p>
<p class="indent">83,655. The title of professor at a college or
University should carry with it dignity and honour, and ought not
to be so freely used as at present. All he asked was that it
should not be abolished at the expense of such Indians as were
doing as good work as their European colleagues.</p>
<p class="indent">83,656. If the Calcutta university continued to
develop its teaching side, there would be no objection to
recruiting University Professors from aided colleges. This would
have certain advantages.</p>
<p class="indent">83,657. (Mr. Fisher). The witness desired to
secure for India Europeans who had European <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id=
"Page_137">[Pg_137]</a></span>reputations in their different
branches of study. If it was necessary to go outside India or
England to procure good men, he would prefer to go to Germany.
This was the practice in America where they were annexing all the
great intellects of Europe.</p>
<p class="indent">83,658. The witness would like to see India
entering the world movement in the advance and march of
knowledge. It was of the highest importance that there should be
an intellectual atmosphere in India. It would be of advantage if
there were many Indians in the Educational Service. For they came
more in contact with the people, and influenced their
intellectual activity. Besides, on retirement they would live in
India and their life experience would be at their countrymen's
service.</p>
<p class="indent">83,659. There was very little in the complaint
made in certain quarters that the work of the Professors in the
colleges in India was hampered by the Government regulations as
to curricula. A good teacher was not troubled by such
matters.</p>
<p class="indent">83,660. (Mr. Sly). There was no scope for the
employment of non-Indians in the high schools as apart from the
colleges. It was in the professorial line that more help from the
West was required.</p>
<p class="indent">83,661. (Mr. Gokhale). The witness knew of
three instances in which the colonies had secured distinguished
men on salaries which were lower than these given to officers of
the Indian Educational <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138"
id="Page_138">[Pg_138]</a></span>Service. One was at Toronto,
another was in New Zealand and the third at Yale university. The
salaries on the two latter cases were &pound;600 and &pound;500 a
year. The same held good as regards Japan. The facts there had
been stated in a Government of India publication as follows:
"Subsequent to 1895 there were 67 Professors recruited in Europe
and America, of those, 20 came from Germany, 16 from England and
16 from the United States. The average pay was &pound;384. In the
highest Imperial University the average pay is &pound;684. As
soon as Japanese could be found to do the work, even tolerably
well, the foreigner was dropped."</p>
<p class="indent">83,662. When the witness first started work in
India, he found that there was no physical laboratory, or any
grant made for a practical experimental course. He had to
construct instruments with the help of local mechanics, whom he
had to train. All this took him ten years. He then undertook
original investigation at his own expense. The Royal Society
became specially interested in his work and desired to give him a
Parliamentary grant for its continuation. It was after this that
the Government of Bengal came forward and offered him facilities
for research.</p>
<p class="indent">83,663. In the Educational Service he would
take men of achievement from anywhere; but men of promise he
would take from his own country.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id=
"Page_139">[Pg_139]</a></span>83,664. (Mr. Chaubal). He did not
know whether the salaries he had mentioned as having been paid in
Japan, New Zealand and Yale were on an incremental scale or not.</p>
<p class="indent">83,665. There was a difference of kind between
the way in which students were taught in schools and the way in
which they were taught in colleges. He did not agree with the
witnesses who had said that during the first year or two years at
college the instruction given was similar to that given in a
school. It was very difficult to disprove or to prove such
statements. There would be no advantage in keeping boys to a
school course up the intermediate standard and making the
colleges deal with only those students who had passed the
intermediate examination.</p>
<p class="indent">83,666. (Sir Theodore Morison). There should be
one scale of pay for all persons in the higher educational
department. The rate of salary, Rs. 200 rising to Rs. 1,500 per
month, was suitable, subject to the proviso that the man of great
distinction, instead of beginning at the lowest rate of pay,
should start some where in the middle of the list, say, at Rs.
400 or Rs. 500. He would make no reference in regard to Europeans
or Indians in that respect. In effect this no doubt amounted to
making Indians eligible for higher educational posts both by
direct recruitment and by promotion.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id=
"Page_140">[Pg_140]</a></span>83,667. He would not favour the
handing over of all the Government institutions in Bengal to
private agencies; there must be one or two Government colleges in
order to keep up the standard. He should be sorry to see the
Government dissociating itself from one of its primary duties,
which was education.</p>
<p class="indent">83,668. Privately managed Colleges paid less in
salary than the Government Colleges. They paid about the same as
was given in the Provincial Service, and they obtained fairly
good men. It would not be right for a great Government to grant a
minimum pay to Indian Professors and an extravagantly high pay to
their European colleagues, for doing the same kind of work.</p>
<p class="indent">83,669. At the Presidency College the
facilities for scientific work were now greater than in many
institutions in England. India was now becoming a great country
for Biological research. Again, the Physical and Chemical
Laboratories at the Presidency College were finer than many in
England. If young men of science in England thought they obtained
better opportunities in pursuing their subjects in New Zealand
and Toronto than in India, the India office ought to remove that
impression at once.</p>
<p class="indent">83,670. (Lord Ronaldshay). When an Indian
graduate under the witnesses' scheme was appointed direct to the
higher service in India he would <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg_141]</a></span>not compel him to go
to England for a period of training. The person who would be
appointed in India directly from the Indian Universities would
have to have previously served with distinction in subordinate
positions; a visit to Europe would be an advantage but not
absolutely necessary.</p>
<p class="indent">83,671. (Mr. Biss). The cost of living in
Calcutta to an Indian Professor or Lecturer would all depend as
the style in which he lived. In each service there is always a
standard of living to which every member is expected to conform.
An Indian Professor had to go to Europe from time to time to keep
himself in touch with the developments of his subject. An Indian
officer had to support a large number of relations. The question
of a man's private expenses should not be raised in fixing his
pay. One might as well inquire whether the candidate for
admission to the service was a bachelor or married, or as to how
many children he had. He had known Europeans who had led a simple
life, and had been all the better for it.</p>
<p class="indent">83,672. He could not understand why men went to
Japan and Canada instead of coming to India on better terms. It
was a mystery to him. He thought it was either sheer ignorance or
the spread of the commercial spirit.</p>
<p class="indent">83,673. All the students coming to his side of
the University, were, as a rule, keen and <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id=
"Page_142">[Pg_142]</a></span>anxious to learn; he could not wish
for better students.</p>
<p class="indent">83,674. (Mr. Gupta). He desired one service,
because he thought it was most degrading that certain men,
although they were doing the same work, should be classed in a
Provincial Service, while others should be classed in an Imperial
Service. The prospect of the members of the Provincial Service
were not at all what they ought to be, and that was the reason
why the best men were not attracted to it.</p>

PROF. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id=
"Page_143">[Pg_143]</a></span>J. C. BOSE AT MADURA</p>
<p class="indent">On his way back to Calcutta from the Fourth
Scientific Deputation to the West, Prof. J. C. Bose visited
Madura, 14th June 1915. The Tamil Sangam presented him with an
address. In reply Dr. Bose made an important speech, in course of
which he said:&mdash;</p>
<p class="indent">I am no longer a representative of Bengal nor
have I come to a strange place, but as an Indian addressing the
mighty India and her people. When we realise that unity of our
destiny then a great future opens out for us.</p>
<p class="indent">It may be we may theorise and attribute to the
plants all the characteristics of the animals; but that will be
merely theory: there will be no proof. There are certain classes
of people who think that plants are utterly unlike animals and
some hold that they are like animals. The mere theory is
absolutely worthless in order to find out the truth. We have to
find by investigation, by means of researches, by means of
proofs, that one is identical with the other. We have not only to
drop all theory but we have to make the plant itself write
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id=
"Page_144">[Pg_144]</a></span>down the answers to the questions
that we have to put to them. That was the great
problem,&mdash;how to make the plant itself answer and write down
answers to the question....</p>
<p class="indent">If the plants are acted on by various medicines
and drugs like ourselves, then we can create an agent or a
spokesman on which we can carry out all future investigations on
the action of drugs. Then there is opened out a great vista for
the scientific study of medicine. And let me tell you medicine is
not yet an exact science. It is merely a phase of tradition. We
have not been able to make medicine scientific. Now by the data
of the influence of drugs on the fundamental basis of life, as is
seen in the plant, we shall be able to make the science of
medicine purely scientific.</p>
<p class="indent">In travelling all over the world, which I have
done several times, I was struck by two great characteristics of
different nations. One characteristic of certain nations is
living for the future. All the modern nations are striving to win
force and power from nature. There is another class of men who
live on the glory of the past. Now, what is to be the future of
our nation? Are we to live only on the glory of the past and die
off from the face of the earth, to show that we are worthy
descendants of the glorious past and to show by our work, by our
intellect and by our service that we <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg_145]</a></span>are
not a decadent nation? We have still a great and mighty future
before us, a future that will justify our ancestry. In talking
about ancestry, do we ever realise that the only way in which we
can do honour to our past is not to boast of what our ancestors
have done but to carry out in the future something as great, if
not greater than they. Are we to be a living nation, to be proud
of our ancestry and to try to win renown by continuous
achievements? These mighty monuments that I see around me tell us
what has been done till very recent times. I have travelled over
some of the greatest ruins of the Universities of India. I have
been to the ruins of the University of Taxilla in the farthest
corner of India which attracted the people of the west and the
east. I had been to the ruins of Nalanda, a University which
invited all the west to gain knowledge under its intellectual
fostering. I had been all there and seen them. I have come here
also and want to visit Conjeevaram. But are you to foster the
dead honours or to try to bring back your University in India and
drag once more from the rest of the world people who would come
down and derive knowledge from India? It is in that way and that
way alone we can win our self-respect and make our life and the
life of the nation worthy. The present era is the era of temples
of learning. In order to erect temples of learning we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id=
"Page_146">[Pg_146]</a></span>require all the offerings of our
mighty people. We want to erect temples and "viharas" which are
so indispensable to the study of nature and her secrets. It is a
problem which appeals to every thoughtful Indian. It is by the
effort of the people and by their generosity that all these
mighty temples arose; and now are we to worship the dead stones
or are we to erect living temples so that the knowledge that has
been made in India shall be perpetuated in India? I received
requests from the different Universities in America and Germany
to allow students from those countries to come and learn the
science that has been initiated in India. Now, is this knowledge
to pass beyond our boundaries to that again in future time we may
have to go to the west to get back this knowledge or are we to
keep this flame of learning burning all the time?</p>

DR. BOSE'S REPLY</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. Bose in reply expressed his thanks for the
great interest shown in different parts of this country in the
success of his work. This was the fourth <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id=
"Page_148">[Pg_148]</a></span>occasion on which he had been
deputed to the West by the Government of India on a scientific
mission, and the success that has attended his visit to foreign
countries has exceeded all his expectations. In Vienna, in Paris,
in Oxford, Cambridge and London, in Harvard, Washington, Chicago
and Columbia, in Tokio and in many other places his work has
uniformly been received with high appreciation. In spite of the
fact that his researches called into question some of the
existing theories, his results have notwithstanding received the
fullest acceptance. This was due to a great extent to the
convincing character of the demonstration afforded by the very
delicate instruments he had been able to invent and which worked
under extremely difficult tests with extraordinary perfection.
Even the most critical savants in Vienna felt themselves
constrained to make a most generous admission. In these new
investigations on the border land between physics and physiology,
they held that Europe has been left behind by India, to which
country they would now have to come for inspiration. It has also
been fully recognised that science will derive benefit when the
synthetic intellectual methods of the East co-operate with the
severe analytical methods of the West. These opinions have also
been fully endorsed in other centres of learning and Dr. Bose had
received applications from distinguished <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id=
"Page_149">[Pg_149]</a></span>Universities in Europe and America
for admission of foreign post graduate scholars to be trained in
his Laboratory in the new scientific methods that have been
initiated in India.</p>

RESEARCH LABORATORY FOR INDIA</p>
<p class="indent">This recognition that the advance of human
knowledge will be incomplete without India's special
contributions, must be a source of great inspiration for future
workers in India. His countrymen had the keen imagination which
could extort truth out of a mass of disconnected facts and the
habit of meditation without allowing the mind to dissipate
itself. Inspired by his visits to the ancient Universities, at
Taxila, at Nalanda and at Conjevaram, Dr. Bose had the strongest
confidence that India would soon see a revival of those glorious
traditions. There will soon rise a Temple of Learning where the
teacher cut off from worldly distractions would go on with his
ceaseless pursuit after truth, and dying, hand on his work to his
disciples. Nothing would seem laborious in his inquiry; never is
he to lose sight of his quest, never is he to let it go obscured
by any terrestrial temptation. For he is the Sanyasin spirit, and
India is the only country where so far from there being a
conflict between science and religion. Knowledge is regarded as
religion itself. Such a misuse of science as is now unfortunately
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id=
"Page_150">[Pg_150]</a></span>in evidence in the West would be
impossible here. Had the conquest of air been achieved in India,
her very first impulse would be to offer worship at every temple
for such a manifestation of the divinity in man.</p>

ECONOMIC DANGER OF INDIA</p>
<p class="indent">One of the most interesting events in his tour
round the world was his stay in Japan, where he had ample
opportunity of becoming acquainted with the efforts of the people
and their aspirations towards a great future. No one can help
being filled with admiration for what they have achieved. In
materialistic efficiency, which in a mechanical era is regarded
as an index of civilisation, they have even surpassed their
German teachers. A few decades ago they had no foreign shipping
and no manufacture. But within an incredibly short time their
magnificent lines of steamers have proved so formidable a
competitor that the great American line in the Pacific will soon
be compelled to stop their sailings. Their industries again,
through the wise help of the State and other adventitious aids
are capturing foreign markets. But far more admirable is their
foresight to save their country from any embroilment with other
nations with whom they want to live in peace. And they realise
any predominant interest of a foreign country in their trade
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id=
"Page_151">[Pg_151]</a></span>or manufacture is sure to lead to
misunderstanding and friction. Actuated by this idea they have
practically excluded all foreign manufactured articles by
prohibitive tariffs.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
REVIVAL OF INDIAN INDUSTRIES</p>
<p class="indent">Is our country slow to realise the danger that
threatens her by the capture of her market and the total
destruction of her industries? Does she not realise that it is
helpless passivity that directly provokes aggression? Has not the
recent happenings in China served as an object lesson? There is,
therefore, no time to be lost and the utmost effort is demanded
of the Government and the people for the revival of our own
industries. The various attempts that have hitherto been made
have not been as successful as the necessity of the case demands.
The efforts of the Government and of the people have hitherto
been spasmodic and often worked at cross purposes. The Government
should have an advisory body of Indian members. There should be
some modification of rules as regards selection of Industrial scholars. Before being sent out to foreign
countries they should be made to study the conditions of
manufacture in this country and its difficulties. For a
particular industry there should be a co-ordinated group of three
scholars, two for the industrial and one for the commercial side.
Difficulties <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id=
"Page_152">[Pg_152]</a></span>would arise in adapting foreign
knowledge to Indian conditions. This can only be overcome by the
devoted labour of men of originality, who have been trained in
our future Research Laboratory. The Government could also
materially help (i) by offering facilities for the supply of raw
materials (ii) by offering expert advice (iii) by starting
experimental industries. He had reason to think that the
Government is full alive to the crucial importance of the subject
and is determined to take every step necessary. In this matter
the aims of the people and the Government are one. In facing a
common danger and in co-operation there must arise mutual respect
and understanding. And perhaps through the very catastrophe that
is threatening the world there may grow up in India a realisation
of community of interest and solidarity as between Government and
people.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
A CALL FOR NOBLER PATRIOTISM</p>
<p class="indent">A very serious danger is thus seen to be
threatening the future of India, and to avert it will require the
utmost effort of the people. They have not only to meet the
economic crisis but also to protect the ideals of ancient Aryan
civilisation from the destructive forces that are threatening it.
Nothing great can be conserved except through constant effort and
sacrifice. There is a danger of, regarding <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg_153]</a></span>the
mechanical efficiency as the sole end of life; there is also the
opposite danger of a life of dreaming, bereft of struggle and
activity, degenerating into parasitic habits of dependence. Only
through the nobler call of patriotism can our nation realise her
highest ideals in thought and in action; to that call the nation
will always respond. He had the inestimable privilege of winning
the intimate friendship of Mr. G. K. Gokhale. Before leaving
England, our foremost Indian statesman whose loss we so deeply
mourn, had come to stay with the speaker for a few days at
Eastbourne. He knew that this was to be their last meeting.
Almost his parting question to Dr. Bose was whether science had
anything to say about future incarnations. For himself, however
he was certain that as soon as he would cast off his worn out frame he was to be born once more in the
country he loved, and bear all the country that may be laid on
him in her service. There can be no doubt that there must be
salvation for a country which can count on sons as devoted as
Gopal Krishna Gokhale.</p>

"Page_154">[Pg_154]</a></span>OF A DISCOVERY</p>
<p class="indent">Substance of a Lecture delivered by Prof. J. C.
Bose on the 20th November 1915, at the Ram Mohan Library, under
the Presidency of the Hon'ble Mr. P. C. Lyon, and published at p.
693, Vol. xviii, of the "Modern Review" (July to December,
1915).</p>
<p class="indent">At the tournament held before the court at
Hastinapur, more than twenty-five centuries ago, Karna, the
reputed son of a Charioteer, had challenged the supremacy of
Prince Arjuna. To this challenge Arjuna
had returned a scornful answer; a prince could not cross swords
with one who could claim no nobility of descent. "I am my own
ancestor," replied Karna, and this perhaps the earliest assertion
of the right of man to choose and determine his own destiny. In
the realm of knowledge also the great achievements have been won
only by men with determined purpose and without any adventitious
aids. Undismayed by human limitations they had struggled in spite
of many a failure. In their inquiry after truth they regarded
nothing as too laborious, nothing too insignificant, nothing too
painful. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id=
"Page_155">[Pg_155]</a></span>This is the process which all must
follow; there is no easier path.</p>
<p class="indent">The lecturer's research on the properties of
Electric Waves was begun just twenty-one years ago. In this he
was greatly encouraged by the appreciation shown by the Royal
Society, which not only published his researches, but also
offered a Parliamentary grant for the continuance of his work.
The greatest difficulty lay in the construction of a receiver to
detect invisible ether disturbances. For this a most laborious
investigation had to be undertaken to find the action of electric
radiation on all kinds of matter. As a result of this long and
very patient work a new type of receiver was invented, so perfect
in its action that the <i>Electrician</i> suggested its use in
ships and electro-magnetic high houses for the communication and
transmission of danger signals at sea through space. This was in
1895, several years in advance of the present wireless system.
Practical application of the result of Dr. Bose's investigations
appear so important that Great Britain and the United States
granted him patents for his invention of a certain crystal
receiver which proved to be the most sensitive detector
of wireless signals.</p>
<p style=

UNIVERSAL SENSITIVENESS OF MATTER</p>
<p class="indent">In the course of his investigations Dr. Bose
found <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id=
"Page_156">[Pg_156]</a></span>that the uncertainty of the early
type of his receiver was brought on by fatigue, and that the
curve of fatigue of his instrument closely resembled the fatigue
curve of animal muscle. He was soon able to remove the
'tiredness' of his receiver by application of suitable
stimulants; application of certain poisons, on the other hand,
permanently abolished its sensitiveness. Dr. Bose was thus amazed
at the discovery that inorganic matter was anything but inert,
but that its particles were a thrill under the action of
multitudinous forces that were playing on it. The lecturer was at
this time constrained to choose whether to go on with the
practical applications of his work, the success of which appeared
to be assured, or to throw himself into a vortex of conflict for
the establishment of some truth the glimmerings of which he was
then but dimly beginning to perceive. It is very curious that the
human mind is sometimes so constituted that it rejects lines of
least resistance in favour of the more difficult path. Dr. Bose
chose the more difficult path, and entered into a phase of
activity which was to test all his strength.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
CASTE IN SCIENCE</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. Bose's discovery of Universal sensitiveness
of matter was communicated to the Royal Society on May 7th, 1901,
when he himself gave a successful <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg_157]</a></span>experimental
demonstration. His communication was, however, strongly assailed
by Sir John Burden-Sanderson, the leading physiologist, and one
or two of his followers. They had nothing to urge against his
experiments but objected to a physicist straying into the
preserve that had been specially reserved for the physiologist.
He had unwittingly strayed into the domain of a new and
unfamiliar caste system and offended its etiquette. In
consequence of this opposition his paper, which was already in
print, was not published. This is not by any means to be regarded
as an injustice done to a stranger. Even Lord Rayleigh, who
occupies an unique position in the world of science, was
subjected to fierce attacks from the chemists, because he, a
physicist, had ventured to predict that the air would be found to
contain new elements not hitherto discovered.</p>
<p class="indent">It is natural that there should be prejudice
against all innovations, and the attitude of Sir John
Burden-Sanderson is easily explained. Unfortunately there was
another incident about which similar explanation could not be
urged. Dr. Bose's Paper had been placed in the archives of the
Royal Society, so that technically there was no publication. And
it came about that eight months after the reading of his Paper,
another communication found publication in the Journal of a
different society which <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158"
id="Page_158">[Pg_158]</a></span>was practically the same as Dr.
Bose's but without any acknowledgment. The author of this
communication was a gentleman who had previously opposed him at
the Royal Society. The plagiarism was subsequently discovered and
led to much unpleasantness. It is not necessary to refer any more
to the subject except as explanation of the fact that the
determined hostility and misrepresentations of one man succeeded
for more than ten years to bar all avenues of publication for his
discoveries. But every cloud has its silver lining; this incident
secured for him many true friends in England who stood for fair
play, and whose friendship has proved to be a source of great
encouragement to him.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
FURTHER DIFFICULTIES</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. Bose's next work in 1903 was the discovery
of the identity of response and of automatic activity in plant
and animal and of the nervous impulse in plant. These new
contributions were regarded as of such great importance that the
Royal Society showed its special appreciation by recommending it
to be published in their Philosophical transactions. But the same
influence which had hitherto stood in his way triumphed once
more, and it was at the very last moment that the publication was
withheld. The Royal Society, however, informed him that his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id=
"Page_159">[Pg_159]</a></span>results were of fundamental
importance, but as they were so wholly unexpected and so opposed
to the existing theories, that they would reserve their judgment
until, at some future time, plants themselves could be made to
record their answers to questions put to them. This was
interpreted in certain quarters here as the final rejection of
Dr. Bose's theories by the Royal Society, and the limited
facilities which he had in the prosecution of his researches were
in danger of being withdrawn. And everything was dark for him for
the next ten years. The only thought that possessed him was how
to make the plant give testimony by means of its own
autograph.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
LONG DELAYED SUCCESS</p>
<p class="indent">And when the night was at its darkest, light
gradually appeared, and after innumerable difficulties had been
overcome his Resonant Recorder was perfected, which enabled the
plant to tell its own story. And in the meantime something still
more wonderful came to pass. Hitherto all gates had been barred
and he had to produce his passports everywhere. He now found
friends who never asked him for credentials. His time had come at
last. The Royal Society found his new methods most convincing and
honoured him by publication of his researches in the
Philosophical transactions. And his discoveries, <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id=
"Page_160">[Pg_160]</a></span>which had so long remained in
obscurity, found enthusiastic acceptance.</p>
<p class="indent">Though his theories had thus received
acceptance from the leading scientific men of the Royal Society,
there was yet no general conviction of the identity of life
reactions in plant and animal. No amount of controversy can
remove the tendency of the human mind to follow precedents. The
only thing left was to make the plant itself bear witness before
the scientific bodies in the West, by means of self-records. At
the recommendation of the Minister of Education, and of the
Government of Bengal, the Secretary of State sanctioned his
scientific deputation to Europe and America.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
JOURNEY OF INDIAN PLANT ROUND THE WORLD</p>
<p class="indent">The special difficulty which he had to contend
against lay in the fact that the only time during which the plant
flourished at all in the West, was in the months of July and
August, when the Universities and scientific societies were in
vacation. The only thing left was to take the bold step of
carrying growing plants from India and trust to human ingenuity
to keep them alive during the journey. Four plants, two Mimosas
and two Telegraph plants, were taken in a portable box with glass
cover, and never let out of sight. In the <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id=
"Page_161">[Pg_161]</a></span>Mediterranean they encountered
bitter cold for the first time and nearly succumbed. They were
unhappier still in the Bay of Biscay, and when they reached
London there was a sharp frost. They had to be kept in a drawing
room lighted by gas, the deadly influence of which was discovered
the next morning when all the plants were found to be apparently
killed. Two had been killed, and the other two were brought round
after much difficulty. The plants were at once transferred to the
hot-house in Regents Park. For every demonstration in Dr. Bose's
private Laboratory at Maida Vale, the plant had to be brought and
returned in a taxicab with closed doors so that no sudden chill
might kill them. When travelling, the large box in which they
were, could not be trusted out of sight in the luggage van. They
had practically to be carried in a reserved compartment. The
unusual care taken of the box always roused the greatest
curiosity, and in an incredibly short time large crowds would
gather. When travelling long distances, for example from London
to Vienna, the carriage accommodation had to be secured in
advance. It was this that saved Dr. Bose from being interned in
Germany, where he was to commence his lectures on the 4th August.
He was to start for the University of Bonn on the 2nd, but on
account of hasty mobilisation of troops in Germany he could not
secure the reserved accommodation. <span class='pagenum'><a name=

the proclamation of War!</p>
<p style=

OUTCOME OF HIS WORK</p>
<p class="indent">The success of his scientific mission exceeded
his most sanguine expectations. The work in which he long
persevered in isolation and under most depressing difficulties,
bore fruit at last. Apart from the full recognition that the
progress of the world's science would be incomplete without
India's special contributions, mutual appreciation and better
understanding resulted from his visit. One of the greatest of
Medical Institutions, the Royal Society of Medicine, has been
pleased to regard his address before the society as one of the
most important in their history and they expected that their
science of medicine would be materially benefited by the
researches that are being carried out by him in India. India has
also been drawn closer to the great seats of learning in the
West, to the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge; for there also
the methods of inquiry initiated here have found the most cordial
welcome. Many Indian students find their way to America,
strangers in a strange land; hitherto they found few to advise
and befriend them. It will perhaps be different now, since their
leading Universities have begged from India the courtesy of hospitality for their post graduate
scholars. Some <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id=
"Page_163">[Pg_163]</a></span>of these Universities again have
asked for a supply of apparatus specially invented at Dr. Bose's
laboratory which in their opinion will mark an epoch in
scientific advance.</p>

THE INEFFABLE WONDER BEHIND THE VEIL</p>
<p class="indent">As for the research itself, he said its
bearings are not exclusively specialistic, but touch the
foundation of various branches of science. To mention only a few;
in medicine it had to deal with the fundamental reaction of
protoplasm to various drugs, the solution of the problem why an
identical agent brings about diametrically opposite effects in
different constitutions; in the science of life it dealt with the
new comparative physiology by which any specific characteristic
of a tissue is traced from the simplest type in plant to the most
complex in the animal; the study of the mysterious phenomenon of
death and the accurate determination of the death point and the
various conditions by which this point may be dislocated
backwards and forwards; in psychology it had to deal with the
unravelling of the great mystery that underlies memory and
tracing it backwards to latent impressions even in the inorganic
bodies which are capable of subsequent revival; and finally, the
determination of the special characteristic of that vehicle
through which sensiferous impulses are transmitted and the
possibility <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id=
"Page_164">[Pg_164]</a></span>of changing the intensity and the
tone of sensation. All these investigations, Dr. Bose said, are
to be carried out by new physical methods of the utmost delicacy.
He had in these years been able to remove the obstacles in the
path and had lifted the veil so as to catch a glimpse of the
ineffable wonder that had hitherto been hidden from view. The
real work, he said, had only just begun.</p>
<p style=

A <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id=
"Page_165">[Pg_165]</a></span>SOCIAL GATHERING</p>
<p class="indent">At the Social Gathering held on the 16th
December 1915, in the compound of the Calcutta Presidency
College, to meet him after his highly successful tour through
Europe, America and Japan, Dr. Bose spoke as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="indent">He said that it was his rare good fortune to
have been amply rewarded for the hardships and struggles that he
had gone through by the generous and friendly feelings of his
colleagues and the love and trust of his pupils. He would say a
few words regarding his experience in the Presidency College for
more than three decades, which he hoped would serve to bring all
who loved the Presidency College&mdash;present and past pupils
and their teachers&mdash;in closer bonds of union. He would speak
to them what he had learnt after years of patient labour, that
the impossible became possible by persistent and determined
efforts and adherence to duty and entire selflessness. The
greatest obstacle often arises out of foolish misunderstanding of
each other's ideals, such as the differing points of view, first
of the Indian teacher, then of his western colleague, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id=
"Page_166">[Pg_166]</a></span>last but not least, the point of
view of the Indian pupils themselves. In all these respects his
experience had been wide and varied. He had both been an
undergraduate and a graduate of the Calcutta University with
vivid realization of an Indian student's aspirations; he had then
become a student of conservative Cambridge and democratic London.
And during his frequent visits to Europe and America he had
become acquainted with the inner working of the chief
universities of the world. Finally he had the unique privilege of
being connected with the Presidency College for thirty-one years,
from which no temptation could sever him. He had the deepest
sense of the sacred vocation of the teacher. They may well be
proud of a consecrated life&mdash;consecrated to what? To the
guidance of young lives, to the making of men, to the shaping and
determining of souls in the dawn of their existence, with their
dreams yet to be realised.</p>
<p class="indent">Education in the West and in the East showed
how different customs and ways might yet express a common ideal.
In India the teacher was, like the head of a family, reverenced
by his pupils so deeply as to show itself by touching the feet of
their master. This in no servile act if we come to think of it;
since it is the expression of the pupils' desire for his master's
blessings, called down from heaven in an almost religious
communion of souls. This consecration <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg_167]</a></span>is
renewed every day, calling forth patient foresight of the
teacher. As the father shows no special favour, but lets his love
and compassion go out to the weakest, so it is with the Indian
teacher and his pupil. There is the relation something very
human, something very ennobling. He would say it was essentially
human rather than distinctively Eastern. For do we not find
something very like it in Mediaeval Europe? There too before the
coming of the modern era with its lack of leisure and its
adherence to system and machinery, there was a bond as sacred
between the master and his pupils. Luther used to salute his
class every morning with lifted hat, "I bow to you, great men of
the future, famous administrators yet to be, men of learning, men
of character who will take on themselves the burden of the
world." Such is the prophetic vision given to the greatest of
teachers. The modern teacher from England will set before him an
ideal not less exalted&mdash;regarding his pupils as his
comrades, he as an Englishman will instill into them
greater virility and a greater public spirit. This will be his
special contribution to the forming of our Indian youths.</p>
<p class="indent">Turning to the Indian students he could say
that it was his good fortune never to have had the harmonious relation between teacher and pupils in
any way ruffled during his long connection with them <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg_168]</a></span>for
more than three decades. The real secret of success was in trying
at times to see things from the student's point of view and to
cultivate a sense of humour enabling him to enjoy the splendid
self-assurance of youth with a feeling not unmixed with envy. In
essential matters, however, one could not wish to meet a better
type or one more quickly susceptible to finer appeals to right
conduct and duty as Indian students. Their faults are rather of
omission than of commission, since in his experience he formed
that the moment they realised their teachers to be their friends,
they responded instantly and did not flinch from any test,
however severe, that could be laid on them.</p>

LIGHT <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id=
"Page_169">[Pg_169]</a></span>VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE</p>
<p class="indent">On the 14th January 1916, Dr. J. C. Bose
delivered a public lecture, on Light Visible and Invisible, at
the third Indian Science Congress held at Lucknow, before a
crowded audience which included the Lieutenant-Governor (Sir
James Meston).</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. Bose, in course of his lecture, spoke of
the imperfection of our senses. Our ear, for example, fails to
respond to all sounds. There are many sounds to which we are
deaf. This was because our ear was tuned to answer to the narrow
range of eleven octaves of sound vibrations. He showed a
remarkable experiment of an artificial ear which remained
irresponsive to various sounds, but when a particular note, to
which it was tuned, was sounded even at the distant end of the
hall, this ear picked it up and responded violently. As there
were sounds audible and inaudible, so there were lights visible
and invisible. The imperfection of our eye as a detector of ether
vibrations was, however, far more serious. The eye could detect
ether vibrations lying within a single octave&mdash;between 400
to 800 billion vibrations per second. Comparatively slow
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id=
"Page_170">[Pg_170]</a></span>vibrations of ether did not affect
our eye and the disturbances they give rise to well-known as
electric waves. The electric waves, predicted by Maxwell, were
discovered by Hertz. These waves were about
three metres long. They were about ten million times larger than
the beams of visible light. Dr. Bose showed that the three short
electric waves have the same property as a beam of light,
exhibiting reflections, refraction, even total reflection,
through a black crystal, double refraction, polarisation, and
rotation of the plane of polarisation. The thinnest film of air
was sufficient to produce total reflection of visible light with
its extremely short wave lengths. But with the new electric waves
which he produced, Dr. Bose showed that the critical thickness of
air space determined by the refracting power of the prison and by
the wave length of electric oscillations. Dr. Bose determined the
index of refraction of electric waves for different materials,
and eliminated a difficulty which presented itself in Maxwell's
theory as to the relation between the index of refraction of
light and the di-electric constant of
insulators. He also measured the wave lengths of various
oscillations. The order to produce short electric oscillations,
to detect them and study their optical properties, he had to
construct a large number of instruments. It was a hard task to
produce very short electric waves which had <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id=
"Page_171">[Pg_171]</a></span>enough energy to be detected, but
Dr. Bose overcame this difficulty by constructing radiators or
oscillators of his own type, which emitted the shortest waves
with sufficient energy. As a receiver he used a sensitive
metallic coherer, which in itself led to new and important
discoveries. When electric waves fall on a loose contact between
two pieces of metals, the resistance of the contact changes and a
current passes through the contact indicating the existence of
electrical oscillations. Dr. Bose discovered the surprising fact
that with potassium metal the resistance of the contact increases
under the action of electric waves and that this contact exhibits
an automatic recovery. He found further that the change of the
metallic contact resistance when acted upon by electric waves, is
a function of the atomic weight. These phenomena led to a new
theory of metallic coherers. Before these discoveries it was
assumed that the particles of the two metallic pieces in contact
are, as it were, fused together, so that the resistance
decreases. But the increasing resistance appearing for some
elements, led to the theory that the electric forces in the waves
produced a peculiar molecular action or a re-arrangement of the
molecules, which may either increase or decrease the contact
resistance.</p>

HINDU <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id=
"Page_172">[Pg_172]</a></span>UNIVERSITY ADDRESS</p>
<p class="indent">The foundation of the Hindu University was laid
by Lord Hardinge on the 4th February 1916. "Many striking
addresses were delivered on the occasion. Professor J.C. Bose in
his masterly address went to the root of the matter and pointed
in an inspiring manner what should be done to make the Hindu
University worthy of its name. He deprecated a repetition of the
Universities of the West." He said:&mdash;</p>
<p class="indent">In tracing the characteristic phenomenon of
life from simple beginnings in that vast region which may be
called unvoiced, as exemplified in the world of plants, to its
highest expression in the animal kingdom, one is repeatedly
struck by the one dominant fact that in order to maintain an
organism at the height of its efficiency something more than a
mechanical perfection of its structure is necessary. Every living
organism, in order to maintain its life and growth, must be in
free communion with all the forces of the Universe about it.</p>
<p style=

STIMULUS <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id=
"Page_173">[Pg_173]</a></span>WITHIN AND WITHOUT</p>
<p class="indent">Further, it must not only constantly receive
stimulus from without, but must also give out something from
within, and the healthy life of the organism will depend on these
two fold activities of inflow and outflow. When there is any
interference with these activities, then morbid symptoms appear,
which ultimately must end in disaster and death. This is equally
true of the intellectual life of a Nation. When through narrow
conceit a Nation regards itself self-sufficient and cuts itself
from the stimulus of the outside world, then intellectual decay
must inevitably follow.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
SPECIAL FUNCTION OF A NATION</p>
<p class="indent">So far as regards the receptive function. Then
there is another function in the intellectual life of a Nation,
that of spontaneous outflow, that giving out of its life by which
the world is enriched. When the Nation has lost this power, when
it merely receives, but cannot give out, then its healthy life is
over, and it sinks into a degenerate existence which is purely
parasitic.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
HOW INDIA CAN TEACH</p>
<p class="indent">How can our Nation give out of the fulness of
the life that is in it, and how can a new Indian <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id=
"Page_174">[Pg_174]</a></span>University help in the realisation
of this object? It is clear that its power of directing and
inspiring will depend on its world status. This can be secured to
it by no artificial means, nor by any strength in the past; and
what is the weakness that has been paralysing her activities for
the accomplishment of any great scientific work? There must be
two different elements, and these must be evenly balanced. Any
excess of either will injure it.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
HOW TO SECURE THIS STATUS</p>
<p class="indent">This world status can only be won by the
intrinsic value of the great contributions to be made by its own
Indian scholars for the advancement of the world's knowledge. To
be organic and vital our new University must stand primarily for
self-expression, and for winning for India a place she has lost.
Knowledge is never the exclusive possession of any particular
race, nor does it recognise geographical limitations. The whole
world is interdependent, and a constant stream of thought had
been carried out throughout the ages enriching the common
heritage of mankind. Although science was neither of the East nor
of the West but international, certain aspects of it gained
richness by reason of their place of origin.</p>
<p class="indent">In any case if India need to make any
contribution <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id=
"Page_175">[Pg_175]</a></span>to the world it should be as great
as the hope they cherished for her. Let them not talk of the
glories of the past till they have secured for her, her true
place among the intellectual nations of the world. Let them find
out how she had fallen from her high estate and ruthlessly put an
end to all that self satisfied and little-minded vanity which had
been the cause of their fatal weakness. What was it that stood in
her way? Was her mind paralysed by weak superstitious fears? That
was not so; for her great thinkers, the Rishis, always stood for
freedom of intellect and while Galileo was imprisoned and Bruno
burnt for their opinions, they boldly declared that even the
Vedas were to be rejected if they did not conform to truth. They
urged in favour of persistent efforts for the discovery of
physical causes yet unknown, since to them nothing was
extra-physical but merely mysterious because of a hitherto
unascertained cause. Were they afraid that the march of knowledge
was dangerous to true faith? Not so. For their knowledge and
religion were one.</p>
<p class="indent">These are the hopes that animate us. For there
is something in the Hindu culture which is possessed of
extraordinary latent strength by which it has resisted the
ravages of time and the destructive changes which have swept over
the earth. And indeed a capacity to endure through infinite
transformations <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id=
"Page_176">[Pg_176]</a></span>must be innate in that mighty
civilisation which has seen the intellectual culture of the Nile
Valley, of Assyria and of Babylon war and wane and disappear and
which to-day gazes on the future with the same invincible faith
with which it met the past.</p>

that often blinds us to the essential. And in solving the mystery
that underlies life, the enlightenment
will come not by the study of the complex man, but through the
simpler plant. It is the unsuspected forces, hidden to the eyes
of men,&mdash;the forces imprisoned in the soil and the stimuli
of alternating flash of light and the gloomings of darkness these
and many others will be found to maintain the ceaseless activity
which we know as the fulness of throbbing life.</p>
<p class="indent">This is likewise true of the congeries of life
which we call a society or a nation. The energy which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id=
"Page_178">[Pg_178]</a></span>moves this great mass in ceaseless
effort to realise some common aspiration, often has its origin in
the unknown solitudes of a village life. And thus the history of
some efforts, not forgotten, which emanated from Faridpore, may
be found not unconnected with which India is now meeting her
problems to-day. How did these problems first dawn in the minds
of some men who forecast themselves by half a century? How fared
their hopes, how did their dreams become buried in oblivion?
Where lies the secret of that potency which makes certain efforts
apparently doomed to failure, rise renewed from beneath the
smouldering ashes? Are these dead failures, so utterly unrelated
to some great success that we may acclaim to day? When we look
deeper we shall find that this is not so, that as inevitable as
in the sequence of cause and effect, so unrelenting must be the
sequence of failure and success. We shall find that the failure
must be the antecedent power to lie dormant for the long
subsequent dynamic expression in what we call success. It is then
and then only that we shall begin to question ourselves which is
the greater of the two, a noble failure or a vulgar success.</p>
<p class="indent">As a concrete example, I shall relate the
history of a noble failure which had its setting in this little
corner of the earth. And if some of the audience thought that the
speaker has been blessed with life <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg_179]</a></span>that has been
unusually fruitful, they will soon realise that the power and
strength that nerved me to meet the shocks of life were in
reality derived at this very place, where I witnessed the
struggle which overpowered a far greater life.</p>

STIMULUS OF CONTACT WITH WESTERN CULTURE</p>
<p class="indent">An impulse from outside reacts on
impressionable bodies in two different ways, depending on whether
the recipient is inert or fully alive. The inert is fashioned
after the pattern of the impression made on it, and this in
infinite repetition of one mechanical stamp. But when an organism
is fully alive, the answering reaction is often of an altogether
different character to the impinging stimulus. The outside shocks
stir up the organism to answer feebly or to utmost in ways as
multitudinous and varied as life itself. So the first impetus of
Western education impressed itself on some in a dead monotony of
imitation of things Western; while in others it awakened all that
was greatest in the national memory. It is the release of some
giant force which lay for long time dormant. My father was one of
the earliest to receive the impetus characteristic of the modern
epoch as derived from the West. And in his case it came to pass
that the stimulus evoked the latent potentialities of his race
for evolving <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id=
"Page_180">[Pg_180]</a></span>modes of expression demanded by the
period of transition in which he was placed. They found
expression in great constructive work, in the restoration of
quiet amidst disorder, in the earliest
effort to spread education both among men and women, in questions
of social welfare, in industrial efforts, in the establishment of
people's Bank and in the foundation of industrial and technical
schools. And behind all these efforts lay a burning love for his
country and its nobler traditions.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
MATTERS EDUCATIONAL</p>
<p class="indent">In educational matters he had very definite
ideas which is now becoming more fully appreciated. English
schools were at that time not only regarded as the only efficient
medium for instruction. While my father's subordinates sent their
children to the English schools intended for gentle folks, I was
sent to the vernacular school where my comrades were hardy sons
of toilers and of others who, it is now the fashion to regard,
were belonging to the depressed classes. From these who tilled
the ground and made the land blossom with green verdure and
ripening corn, and the sons of the fisher folk, who told stories
of the strange creatures that frequented the unknown depths of
mighty rivers and stagnant pools, I first derived the lesson of
that which constitutes true manhood. From them too I drew my love
of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id=
"Page_181">[Pg_181]</a></span>nature. When I came home
accompanied by my comrades I found my mother waiting for us. She
was an orthodox Hindu, yet the "untouchableness" of some of my
school fellows did not produce any misgivings in her. She
welcomed and fed all these as her own children; for it is only
true of the mother heart to go out and enfold in her protecting
care all those who needed succour and a mother's affection. I now
realise the object of my being sent at the most plastic period of
my life to the vernacular school, where I was to learn my own
language, to think my own thoughts and to receive the heritage of
our national culture through the medium of our own literature. I
was thus to consider myself one with the people and never to
place myself in an equivocal position of assumed superiority.
This I realised more particularly when later I wished to go to
Europe and to compete for the Indian Civil Service, his refusal
as regards that particular career was absolute. I was to rule
nobody but myself, I was to be a scholar not an
administrator.</p>

THE HISTORY OF A FAILURE THAT WAS GREAT</p>
<p class="indent">There has been some complaint that the
experiment of meeting out cut and dried moral texts as a part of
school routine has not proved to be so effective as was expected
by their promulgators. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182"
id="Page_182">[Pg_182]</a></span>The moral education which we
received in our childhood was very indirect and came from
listening to stories recited by the 'Kathas' on various incidents
connected with our great epics. Their effect on our minds was
very great; this may be because our racial memory makes us more
prone to respond to certain ideals that have been impressed on
the consciousness of the nation. These early appeals to our
emotions have remained persistent; the only difference is that
which was there as a narrative of incidents more or less
historical, is now realised as eternally true, being an allegory
of the unending struggle of the human soul in its choice between
what is material and that other something which transcends it.
The only pictures now in my study are a few frescoes done for me
by Abanindra Nath Tagore and Nanda Lal Bose. The first fresco
represents Her, who is the Sustainer of the Universe. She stands
pedestalled on the lotus of our heart. The world was at peace;
but a change has come. And She under whose Veil of Compassion we
had been protected so long, suddenly flings us to the world of
conflict. Our great epic, the Mahabharata, deals with this great
conflict, and the few frescoes delineate some of the fundamental
incidents. The coming of the discord is signalled by the rattle
of dice, thrown by Yudhisthira, the pawn at stake, being the
crown. Two hostile arrays are set in <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id=
"Page_183">[Pg_183]</a></span>motion, mighty Kaurava armaments
meeting in shock of battle the Pandava host with Arjuna as the
leader, and Krishna as his Divine Charioteer. At the supreme
moment Arjuna had flung down his earthly weapon, Gandiva. It was
then that the eternal conflict between matter and spirit was
decided. The next panel shows the outward or the material aspect
of victory. Behind a foreground of waving flags is seen the
battle field of Kurukshetra with procession of white-clad
mourning women seen by fitful lights of funeral pyres. In the
last panel is seen Yudhisthira renouncing the fruits of his
victory setting out on his last journey. In front of him lies the
vast and sombre plain and mountain peaks, faintly visible by
gleams of unearthly light, unlocalised but playing here and
there. His wife and his brothers had fallen behind and dropped
one by one. There is to be no human companion in his last
journey. The only thing that stood by him and from which he had
never been really separated is Dharma or the Spirit of
Righteousness.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
LIFE OF ACTION</p>
<p class="indent">Faridpur at that time enjoyed a notoriety of
being the stronghold of desperate characters, dacoits by land and
water. My father had captured single-handed one of the principal
leaders, whom he sentenced to a long term of imprisonment. After
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id=
"Page_184">[Pg_184]</a></span>release he came to my father and
demanded some occupation, since the particular vocation in which
he had specialised was now rendered impossible. My father took
the unusual course to employ him as my special attendant to carry
me, a child of four, on his back to the distant village school.
No nurse could be tenderer than this ex-leader of lawless men,
whose profession had been to deal out wounds and deaths. He had
accepted a life of peace but he could not altogether wipe out his
old memories. He used to fill my infant mind with the stories of
his bold adventures, the numerous fights in which he had taken
part, the death of his companions and his hair-breadth escapes.
Numerous were the decorations he bore. The most conspicuous was
an ugly mark on his breast left by an arrow and a hole on the
thigh caused by a spear thrust. The trust imposed on this
marauder proved to be not altogether ill placed for once in a
river journey we were pursued by several long boats filled with
armed dacoits. When these boats came too near for us to effect an
escape the erstwhile dacoit leader, my attendant, stood up and
gave a peculiar cry, which was evidently understood. For the
pursuing boats vanished at the signal.</p>
<p style=

INDUSTRIAL EFFORTS</p>
<p class="indent">I come now to another period of his life fifty
years from now, when he foresaw the economic danger <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id=
"Page_185">[Pg_185]</a></span>that threatened his country. This
Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition was one of the first means
he thought of to avert the threatened danger. Here also he
attempted to bring together other activities. Evening
entertainments were given by the performances of "Jatras," which
have been the expression of our national drama and which have
constantly enriched our Bengali literature by the contributions
of village bards and composers. There were athletic tournaments
also and display of physical strength and endurance. He also
established here the people's Bank, which is now in a most
flourishing condition. He established industrial and technical
schools, and it was there that the inventive bend of my mind
received its first impetus. I remember the deep impression made
on my mind by the form of worship rendered by the artisans to
Viswakarma God in his aspect as the Great Artificer: His hand it
was that was moulding the whole creation; and it seemed that we
were the instruments in his hand, through whom he intended to
fashion some Great Design.</p>
<p class="indent">In practical agriculture my father was among
Indians one of the first to start a tea industry in Assam, now
regarded as one of the most flourishing. He gave practically
everything in the starting of some Weaving Mills. He stood by
this and many other efforts in industrial developments. The
success of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id=
"Page_186">[Pg_186]</a></span>which I spoke did not come till
long after&mdash;too late for him to see it. He had come before
the country was ready, and it happened to him as it must happen
to all pioneers. Every one of his efforts failed and the crash
came. And a great burden fell on us which was only lifted by our
united effects just before his work here was over.</p>
<p class="indent">A failure? Yes but not ignoble or altogether
futile. Since it was through the witnessing of this struggle that
the son learned to look on success or failure as one, to realise
that some defeat was greater than victory. And if my life in any
way proved to be fruitful, then that came through the realisation
of this lesson.</p>
<p class="indent">To me his life had been one of blessing and
daily thanksgiving. Nevertheless every one had said that he
wrecked his life which was meant for far greater things. Few
realise that out of the skeletons of myriad lives have been built
vast continents. And it is on the wreck of a life like his and of
many such lives there will be built the Greater India yet to be.
We do not know why it should be so, but we do know that the Earth
Mother is hungry for sacrifice.</p>

QUEST <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id=

<p class="indent">Sir Jagadis Chandra Bose delivered the
following Address, on the 25th February 1917, to the students of
the Presidency College on receiving their <i>Arghya</i> and
congratulations on the occasion of his knighthood. It was
published in the Modern Review for March 1917&mdash;Volume XXI,
p. 343.</p>
<p class="indent">In your congratulations for the recent honour,
you have overlooked a still greater that came to me a year ago,
when I was gazetted as your perpetual professor, so that the tie
which binds me to you is never to be severed. Thirty-two years
ago I sought to be your teacher. For the trust that you imposed
on me could I do anything less than place before you the highest

strength. I never set before you that was easy but used all the
compulsion for the choice of the most difficult. And perhaps as a
reward for these years of effort I find all over India those who
have been my pupils occupying positions of the highest trust and
responsibility in different walks of life. I do not merely count
those who have won fame and success but I also claim <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id=

THE LAW UNIVERSAL</p>
<p class="indent">Through science I was able to teach you how the
seeming veils the real; how though the garish lights dazzle and
blind us, there are lights invisible, which glow persistently
after the brief flare burns out. One came to realise how all
matter was one, how unified all life was. In the various
expressions of life even in the realm of thought the same
Universal law prevails. There was no such thing as brute matter,
but that spirit suffused matter in which it was enshrined. One
also realised dimly a mysterious Cyclic Law of Change, seen not
merely in inorganic matter but also in organised life and its
highest manifestations. One saw how inertness passes into the
climax of activity and how that climax is perilously near its
antithetic decline. This basic change puzzles us by its seeming
caprice not merely in our physical instruments but also in the
cycle of individual life and death and in the great cycle of the
life and death of nations. We fail to see things in their
totality and we erect barriers that keep kindreds apart. Even
science which attempts to rise above common limitations, has not
escaped the doom which limited vision imposes. We have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id=
"Page_189">[Pg_189]</a></span>caste in science as in religion and
in politics, which divides one into conflicting many. The law of
Cyclic change follows us relentlessly even in the realm of
thought. When we have raised ourselves to the highest pinnacle,
through some oversight we fall over the precipice. Men have
offered their lives for the establishment of truth. A climax is
reached after which the custodians of knowledge themselves bar
further advance. Men who have fought for liberty impose on
themselves and on others the bond of slavery. Through centuries
have men striven to erect a mighty edifice in which Humanity
might be enshrined; through want of vigilance the structure
crumbled into dust. Many cycles must yet be run and defeats must
yet be borne before man will establish a destiny which is above
change.</p>
<p class="indent">And through science I was able to teach you to
seek for truth and help to discover it yourself. This attitude of
detachment may possess some advantage in the proper understanding
of your duties. You will have, besides, the heritage of great
ideals that have been handed down to you. The question which you
have to decide is duty to yourself, to the king and to your
country. I shall speak to you of the ideals which we cherish
about these duties.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
DUTY TO SELF</p>
<p class="indent">As regards duty to self, can there be anything
so <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id=
"Page_190">[Pg_190]</a></span>inclusive as being true to your
manhood? Stand upright and do not be either cringing or vulgarly
self-assertive. Be righteous. Let your words and deeds
correspond. Lead no double life. Proclaim what you think
right.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
IDEAL OF KINGSHIP</p>
<p class="indent">The Indian ideal of kingship will be clear to
you if I recite the invocation with which we crowned our kings
from the Vedic Times:</p>
<p class="blockquot">"Be with us. We have chosen thee<br />
Let all the people wish for thee<br />
Stand steadfast and immovable<br />
Be like a mountain unremoved<br />
And hold thy kingship in thy grasp."</p>
<p class="indent">We have chosen thee, our prayers have
consecrated thee, for all the wishes of the people went with
thee. Thou art to stand as mountain unremoved, for thy throne is
planted secure on the hearts of thy people. Stand steadfast then,
for we have endowed thee with power irresistible. Fall therefore
not away; but let thy sceptre be held firmly in thy grasp.</p>
<p class="indent">Which is more potent, Matter or Spirit? Is the
power with which the people endow their king identical with the
power of wealth with which we enrich him by paying him his Royal
dues? We make him irresistible not by wealth but by <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg_191]</a></span>the
strength of our lives, the strength of our mind, may, we have to
pay him more according to our ancient Lawgivers, in as much as
the eighth part of our deeds and virtues, and the merit we have
ourselves acquired. We can only make him irresistible by the
strength of our lives, the strength of our minds, and the
strength that comes out of righteousness.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
DUTY TO OUR COUNTRY</p>
<p class="indent">And lastly, what are our duties to our country?
These are essentially to win honour for it and also win for it
security and peace. As regards winning honour for our country, it
is true that while India has offered from the earliest times
welcome and hospitality to all peoples and nationalities her
children have been subjected to intolerable humiliations in other
countries even under the flag of our king.</p>
<p class="indent">There can be no question of the fundamental
duty of every Indian to stand up and uphold the honour of his
country and strove for the removal of wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">The general task of redressing wrong is not a
problem of India alone, but one in which the righteous men are
interested the world over. For wrong cries for redress
everywhere, in the clashings interests of the rich and poor,
between capital and labour, between those who hold the power and
those from whom it has been withheld,&mdash;in a word in the
struggle of the Disinherited.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id=
"Page_192">[Pg_192]</a></span>When any man is rendered unable to
uphold his manhood and self-respect and woman are deprived of the
chivalrous protection and consideration of men and subjected to
degradation, the general level of manhood or womanhood in the
world is lowered. It then becomes an outrage to humanity and a
challenge to all men to safeguard the sacredness of our common
human nature.</p>
<p class="indent">What is the machinery which sets a going a
world movement for the redress of wrong? For this I need not cite
instances from the history of other countries but take one which
is known to you and in which the living actors are still among
us. In the midst of the degradation of his countrymen in South
Africa, there stood up a man himself nurtured in luxury, to take
up the burden of the disinherited. His wife too stood by him, a
lady of gentle birth. We all know who that man is&mdash;he is
Gandhi,&mdash;and what humiliations and suffering he went
through. Do you think he suffered in vain and that his voice
remained unheard? It was not so, for in the great vortex of
passion for Justice, there were caught others&mdash;men like
Polak and Andrews. Are they your countrymen? Not in the narrow
sense of the word but truly in a larger sense, that these who
choose to bear and suffer belong to one clan the clan from which
Kshatriya Chivalry is recruited. The removal of suffering and of
the cause of suffering is <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg_193]</a></span>the Dharma of the
strong Kshatriya. The earth is the wide and universal theatre of
man's woeful pageant. The question is who is to suffer more than
his share. Is the burden to fall on the weak or the strong? Is it
to be under hopeless compulsion or of voluntary acceptance?</p>

DEFENCE OF HOMELAND</p>
<p class="indent">In your services for your country there is no
higher at the present moment than to ensure for her security and
peace. We have so long enjoyed the security of peace without
being called upon to maintain it. But this is no longer so.</p>
<p class="indent">At no time within the recent history of India
has there been so quick a readjustment and appreciation as
regards proper understanding of the aspiration of the Indian
people. This has been due to what India has been able to offer
not merely in the regions of thought but also in the fields of
battle.</p>

MASS RESPONSE</p>
<p class="indent">And remember that when the world is in
conflagration, this corner which has hitherto escaped it, will
not evade the peril which threatens it. The march of disaster
will then be terribly rapid. You have soon to prepare yourself
against any hostile sides. You can only withstand it if the whole
people realise the imminent danger. You can by your <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id=
"Page_194">[Pg_194]</a></span>thought and by your action awaken
and influence the multitude. Do not have any misgivings about the
want of long previous preparations. Have you not already seen how
mind triumphs over matter and have not some of you with only a
few months' preparation stood fearless at your post in
Mesopotamia and won recognition by your calm collectedness and
true heroism? They may say that you are but a small handful, what
of the vast illiterate millions? Illiterate in what sense? Have
not the ballads of these illiterates rendered into English by our
Poet touched profoundly the hearts of the very elect of the West?
Have not the stories of their common life appealed to the common
kinship of humanity? If you still have some doubts about the
power of the multitude to respond instantly to the call of duty,
I shall relate an incident which came within my own personal
experience. I had gone on a scientific expedition to the borders
of the Himalayan terrai of Kumaun; a narrow ravine was between me
and the plateau on the other side. Terror prevailed among the
villagers on the other side of the ravine; for a tigress had come
down from the forest. And numerous had been the toll in human
lives exacted. Petitions had been sent up to the Government and
questions had been asked in Parliament. A reward of Rs. 500 had
been offered. Various captains in the army with battery of guns
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id=
"Page_195">[Pg_195]</a></span>came many a time, but the reward
remained unclaimed. The murderess of the forest would come out
even in broad day-light and leisurely take her victims from away
their companions. Nothing could circumvent her demoniac cunning.
When all hopes had nearly vanished, the villagers went to Kaloo
Singh, who possessed an old matchlock. At the special sanction of
the Magistrate he was allowed to buy a quantity of gunpowder; the
bullets he himself made by melting bits of lead. With his
primitive weapon with the entreaties of his villagers ringing in
his ears Kaloo Singh started on his perilous journey. At midday I
was startled by the groanings of some animals in pain. The
tigress had sprung among a herd of buffalo and with successive strokes of its mighty paws had
killed two buffaloes and left them in the field. Kaloo Singh
waited there for the return of the tigress to the kill. There was
not a tree near by; only there was a low bush behind which he lay
crouched. After hours of waiting as the sun was going down he was
taken aback by the sudden apparition of the tigress which stood
within six feet of him. His limbs had become half paralysed from
cold and his crouching position. Trying to raise his gun he could
take no aim as his arm was shaking with involuntary fear. Kaloo
Singh explained to me afterwards how he succeeded in shaking off
his mortal terror. "I quietly said to myself, <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id=
"Page_196">[Pg_196]</a></span>Kaloo Singh, Kaloo Singh, who sent
you here? Did not the villagers put their trust on you! I could
then no longer lie in hiding, and I stood up and something
strange and invigorating crept up strength into my
body. All the trembling went and I became as hard as steel. The
tigress had seen me and with eyes blazing crouched for the spring
lashing its tail. Only six feet lay between. She sprang and my
gun also went off at the same time and she missed her aim and
fell dead close to me." That was how a common villager went off
to meet death at the call of something for which he could give no
name and the mother and wife of Kaloo Singh had also bidden him
go. There are millions of Kaloo Singhs with mother and sisters
and wife to send them forth. And you too have many loved ones who
would themselves bid you arm for the defence of your homes.</p>

DIFFERENCE OF TEMPERAMENT</p>
<p class="indent">The issue is clear, and immediate action is
imperative. But action is delayed by misunderstanding arising out
of temperamental differences between the Governing Class and the
People. Curiously enough the respective responsive
characteristics of the Anglo Saxon and the Indians are paralleled by the two types of responses seen in
all living matter. In the one type the response is slow but
proportionate to the stimulus that excites it. The response
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id=
"Page_197">[Pg_197]</a></span>grows with the strength of external
force. In the other it is quite different&mdash;here it is an
all-or-none principle. It either responds to
the utmost or nothing at all. This is also illustrated in the
different racial characteristics. The Anglo Saxon has even by his
rights by struggle, step by step. The insignificant little has,
by accumulation, became large, and which has been gained, has
been gained for all time. But in the Indian the ideal and the
emotional are the only effective stimulus. The ideal of his King
is Rama, who renounced his kingdom and even his beloved for an
idea. One day a king and another day a bare-footed wanderer in
the forest! Who cares? All or nothing!</p>
<p class="indent">The concessions made by a modern form of
Government safeguarded by necessary limitations may appear almost
as grudging gifts. The Indian wants something which comes with
unhesitating frankness and warmth and strikes his ideality and
imagination. But ancient and modern kingship are sometimes at one
in direct and spontaneous pronouncement of the royal sympathy.
Such was the Proclamation of Queen Victoria which stirred to its
depths the popular heart.</p>
<p class="indent">"In the Prosperity of Our subjects will be our
strength, in their contentment Our security, in their Gratitude
Our best Reward."</p>
<p class="indent">That there are increasingly frequent reflexes
in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id=
"Page_198">[Pg_198]</a></span>our Government to popular needs and
wishes is happily illustrated at a most opportune moment from the
statements in the recent <i>Gazette of India</i> and cables
received from London. In the former we find that the Viceroy and
his council had recommended the abolition of the system of
indentured labour. In the telegram from London Mr. Chamberlain
states that the Viceroy has informed him that Indians will be
eligible for commissions in the New Defence of India Army.</p>

is marching with giant strides. Brief will be his hesitation

impending disaster, rather provoke it. When that comes, as
assuredly it will unless we are prepared to resist, havoc will be
let loose and horrors perpetrated before which the imagination
quails back in dismay.</p>
<p class="indent">I have tried to lay before you as
dispassionately as I could the issues involved. But some of you
may cry out and say, we can not live in cold scientific and
philosophic abstractions. Emotion is more <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg_199]</a></span>to
us than pure reasoning. We cannot stay in this indecision which
is paralysing our wills and crushing the soul out of us. The
world is offering their best and behold them marching to be
immolated so that by the supreme offering of death they might win
safety and honor for their motherland. There is no time for
wavering. We too will throw in our lot with those who are
fighting. They say that by our lives we shall win for our
birth-land an honoured place in their federation. We
shall trust them. We shall stand by their side and fight for our
home and homeland. And let Providence shape the Issue.</p>

THE <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id=
"Page_200">[Pg_200]</a></span>VOICE OF LIFE</p>
<p class="indent">The following is the Inaugural Address
delivered by Sir J. C. Bose, on the 30th November 1917, in
dedicating the Bose Institute to the Nation.</p>
<p class="indent">I dedicate to-day this Institute&mdash;not
merely a Laboratory but a Temple. The power of physical methods
applies for the establishment of that truth which can be realised
directly through our senses, or through the vast expansion of the
perceptive range by means of artificially created organs. We
still gather the tremulous message when the note of the audible
reaches the unheard. When human sight fails, we continue to
explore the region of the invisible. The little that we can see
is as nothing compared to the vastness of that which we cannot.
Out of the very imperfection of his senses man has built himself
a raft of thought by which he makes daring adventures on the
great seas of the Unknown. But there are other truths which will
remain beyond even the supersensitive methods known to science.
For these we require faith, tested not in a few years but by an
entire life. And a temple is erected as a fit memorial for the
establishment of that truth for which faith was needed. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id=
"Page_201">[Pg_201]</a></span>personal, yet general, truth and
faith whose establishment this Institute commemorates is this:
that when one dedicates himself wholly for a great object, the
closed doors shall open, and the seemingly impossible will become
possible for him.</p>
<p class="indent">Thirty-two years ago I chose teaching of
science as my vocation. It was held that by its very peculiar
constitution, the Indian mind would always turn away from the
study of Nature to metaphysical speculations. Even had the
capacity for inquiry and accurate observation been assumed
present, there were no opportunities for their employment; there
were no well-equipped laboratories nor skilled mechanicians. This
was all too true. It is for man not to quarrel with circumstances
but bravely accept them; and we belong to that race and dynasty
who had accomplished great things with simple means.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
FAILURE AND SUCCESS</p>
<p class="indent">This day twenty-three years ago, I resolved
that as far as the whole-hearted devotion and faith of one man
counted, that would not be wanting and within six months it came
about that some of the most difficult problems connected with
Electric Waves found their solution in my Laboratory and received
high appreciation from Lord Kelvin, Lord Rayleigh and other
leading physicists. The Royal Society <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id=
"Page_202">[Pg_202]</a></span>honoured me by publishing my
discoveries and offering, of their own accord, an appropriation
from the special Parliamentary Grant for the advancement of
knowledge. That day the closed gates suddenly opened and I hoped
that the torch that was then lighted would continue to burn
brighter, and brighter. But man's faith and hope require repeated
testing. For five years after this, the progress was interrupted;
yet when the most generous and wide appreciation of my work had
reached almost the highest point there came a sudden and
unexpected change.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
LIVING AND NON-LIVING</p>
<p class="indent">In the pursuit of my investigations I was
unconsciously led into the border region of physics and
physiology and was amazed to find boundary lines vanishing and
points of contact emerge between the realms of the Living and
Non-living. Inorganic matter was found anything but inert; it
also was a thrill under the action of multitudinous forces that
played on it. A universal reaction seemed to bring together
metal, plant and animal under a common law. They all exhibited
essentially the same phenomena of fatigue and depression,
together with possibilities of recovery and of exaltation, yet
also that of permanent irresponsiveness which is associated with
death. I was filled with awe at this stupendous <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id=
"Page_203">[Pg_203]</a></span>generalisation; and it was with
great hope that I announced my results before the Royal
Society,&mdash;results demonstrated by experiments. But the
physiologists present advised me, after my address, to confine
myself to physical investigations in which my success had been
assured, rather than encroach on their preserve. I had thus
unwittingly strayed into the domain of a new and unfamiliar caste
system and so offended its etiquette. An unconscious theological
bias was also present which confounds ignorance with faith. It is
forgotten that He, who surrounded us with this ever-evolving
mystery of creation, the ineffable wonder that lies hidden in the
microcosm of the dust particle, enclosing within the intricacies
of its atomic form all the mystery of the cosmos, has also
implanted in us the desire to question and understand. To the
theological bias was added the misgivings about the inherent bent
of the Indian mind towards mysticism and unchecked imagination.
But in India this burning imagination which can extort new order
out of a mass of apparently contradictory facts, is also held in
check by the habit of meditation. It is this restraint which
confers the power to hold the mind in pursuit of truth, in
infinite patience, to wait, and reconsider, to experimentally
test and repeatedly verify.</p>
<p class="indent">It is but natural that there should be
prejudice, even in science, against all innovations; and I was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id=
"Page_204">[Pg_204]</a></span>prepared to wait till the first
incredulity could be overcome by further cumulative evidence.
Unfortunately there were other incidents and misrepresentations
which it was impossible to remove from this insulating distance. Thus no conditions could have
been more desperately hopeless than those which confronted me for
the next twelve years. It is necessary to make this brief
reference to this period of my life; for one who would devote
himself to the search of truth must realise that for him there
awaits no easy life, but one of unending struggle. It is for him
to cast his life as an offering, regarding gain and loss, success
and failure, as one. Yet in my case this long persisting gloom
was suddenly lifted. My scientific deputation in 1914, from the
Government of India, gave the opportunity of giving
demonstrations of my discoveries before the leading scientific
societies of the world. This led to the acceptance of my theories
and results, and the recognition of the importance of the Indian
contribution to the advancement of the world's science. My own
experience told me how heavy, sometimes even crushing, are the
difficulties which confront an inquirer here in India; yet it
made me stronger in my determination, that I shall make the path
of those who are to follow me less arduous, and that India, is
never to relinquish what has been won for her after years of
struggle.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
THE <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id=
"Page_205">[Pg_205]</a></span>TWO IDEALS</p>
<p class="indent">What is it that India is to win and maintain?
Can anything small or circumscribed ever satisfy the mind of
India? Has her own history and the teaching of the past prepared
her for some temporary and quite subordinate gain? There are at
this moment two complementary and not antagonistic ideals before
the country. India is drawn into the vortex of international
competition. She has to become efficient in every
way,&mdash;through spread of education, through performance of
civic duties and responsibilities, through activities both
industrial and commercial. Neglect of these essentials of
national duty will imperil her very existence; and sufficient
stimulus for these will be found in success and satisfaction of
personal ambition.</p>
<p class="indent">But these alone do not ensure the life of a
nation. Such material activities have brought in the West their
fruit, in accession of power and wealth. There has been a
feverish rush even in the realm of science, for exploiting
applications of knowledge, not so often for saving as for
destruction. In the absence of some power of restraint,
civilisation is trembling in an unstable poise on the brink of
ruin. Some complementary ideal there must be to save man from
that mad rush which must end in disaster. He has followed the
lure and excitement of some insatiable ambition, never pausing
for a moment to think of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206"
id="Page_206">[Pg_206]</a></span>the ultimate object for which
success was to serve as a temporary incentive. He forgot that far
more potent than competition was mutual help and co-operation in
the scheme of life. And in this country through milleniums, there
always have been some who, beyond the immediate and absorbing
prize of the hour, sought for the realisation of the highest
ideal of life&mdash;not through passive renunciation, but through
active struggle. The weakling who has refused the conflict,
having acquired nothing has nothing to renounce. He alone who has
striven and won, can enrich the world by giving away the fruits
of his victorious experience. In India such examples of constant
realisation of ideals through work have resulted in the formation
of a continuous living tradition. And by her latent power of
rejuvenescence she has readjusted herself through infinite
transformations. Thus while the soul of Babylon and the Nile
Valley have transmigrated, ours still remains vital and with
capacity of absorbing what time has brought, and making it one
with itself.</p>
<p class="indent">The ideal of giving, of enriching, in fine, of
self-renunciation in response to the highest call of humanity is
the other and complementary ideal. The motive power for this is
not to be found in personal ambition but in the effacement of all
littlenesses, and uprooting of that ignorance which regards
anything as gain which is to be purchased <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg_207]</a></span>at
others' loss. This I know, that no vision of truth can come
except in the absence of all sources of distraction, and when the
mind has reached the point of rest.</p>
<p class="indent">Public life, and the various professions will
be the appropriate spheres of activity for many aspiring young
men. But for my disciples, I call on those very few, who,
realising inner call, will devote their whole life with
strengthened character and determined purpose to take part in
that infinite struggle to win knowledge for its own sake and see
truth face to face.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
ADVANCEMENT AND DIFFUSION OF KNOWLEDGE</p>
<p class="indent">The work already carried out in my laboratory
on the response of matter, and the unexpected revelations in
plant life, foreshadowing the wonders of the highest animal life,
have opened out very extended regions of inquiry in Physics, in
physiology in Medicine, in Agriculture and even in Psychology.
Problems, hitherto regarded as insoluble, have now been brought
within the sphere of experimental investigation. These inquiries
are obviously more extensive than those customary either among
physicists or physiologists, since demanding interests and
aptitudes hitherto more or less divided between them. In the
study of Nature, there is a <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg_208]</a></span>necessity of the dual
view point, this alternating yet rhythmically unified interaction
of biological thought with physical studies, and physical thought
with biological studies. The future worker with his freshened
grasp of physics, his fuller conception of the inorganic world,
as indeed thrilling with "the promise and potency of life" will
redouble his former energies of work and thought. Thus he will be
in a position to win now the old knowledge with finer sieves, to research it
with new enthusiasm and subtler instruments. And thus with
thought and toil and time he may hope to bring fresher views into
the old problems. His handling of these will be at once more
vital and more kinetic, more comprehensive and unified.</p>
<p class="indent">The farther and fuller investigation of the
many and ever-opening problems of the nascent science which
includes both Life and Non-Life are among the main purposes of
the Institute I am opening to-day; in these fields I am already
fortunate in having a devoted band of disciples, whom I have been
training for the last ten years. Their number is very limited,
but means may perhaps be forthcoming in the future to increase
them. An enlarging field of young ability may thus be available,
from which will emerge, with time and labour, individual
originality of research, productive invention and some day even
creative genius.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id=
"Page_209">[Pg_209]</a></span>But high success is not to be
obtained without corresponding experimental exactitude, and this
is needed to-day more than ever, and to-morrow yet more again.
Hence the long battery of supersensitive instruments and
apparatus, designed here, which stand before in their cases in
our entrance hall. They will tell you of the protracted struggle
to get behind the deceptive seeming into the reality that
remained unseen;&mdash;of the continuous toil and persistence and
of ingenuity called forth for overcoming human limitations. In
these directions through the ever-increasing ingenuity of device
for advancing science, I see at no distant future an advance of
skill and of invention among our workers; and if this skill be
assured, practical applications will not fail to follow in many
fields of human activity.</p>
<p class="indent">The advance of science is the principal object
of this Institute and also the diffusion of knowledge. We are
here in the largest of all the many chambers of this House of
Knowledge&mdash;its Lecture Room. In adding this feature, and on
a scale hitherto unprecedented in a Research Institute, I have
sought permanently to associate the advancement of knowledge with
the widest possible civic and public diffusion of it; and this
without any academic limitations, henceforth to all races and
languages, to both men and women alike, and for all time
coming.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id=
"Page_210">[Pg_210]</a></span>The lectures given here will not be
mere repetitions of second-hand knowledge. They will announce to
an audience of some fifteen hundred people, the new discoveries
made here, which will be demonstrated for the first time before
the public. We shall thus maintain continuously the highest aim
of a great Seat of Learning by taking active part in the
<i>advancement</i> and diffusion of knowledge. Through the
regular publication of the Transactions of the Institute, these
Indian contributions will reach the whole world. The discoveries
made will thus become public property. No patents will ever be
taken. The spirit of our national culture demands that we should
for ever be free from the desecration of utilising knowledge for
personal gain. Besides the regular staff there will be a selected
number of scholars, who by their work have shown special
aptitude, and who would devote their whole life to the pursuit of
research. They will require personal training and their number
must necessarily be limited. But it is not the quantity but
quality that is of essential importance.</p>
<p class="indent">It is my further wish, that as far as the
limited accommodation would permit, the facilities of this
Institute should be available to workers from all countries. In
this I am attempting to carry out the traditions of my country,
which so far back as twenty-five centuries ago, welcomed all
scholars <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id=
"Page_211">[Pg_211]</a></span>from different parts of the world,
within the precincts of its ancient seats of learning, at Nalanda
and at Taxilla.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
THE SURGE OF LIFE</p>
<p class="indent">With this widened outlook, we shall not only
maintain the highest traditions of the past but also serve the
world in nobler ways. We shall be at one with it in feeling the
common surgings of life, the common love for the good, the true
and the beautiful. In this Institute, this Study and Garden of
Life, the claim of art has not been forgotten, for the artist has
been working with us, from foundation to pinnacle, and from floor
to ceiling of this very Hall. And beyond that arch the Laboratory
merges imperceptibly into the garden, which is the true
laboratory for the study of Life. There the creepers, the plants
and the trees are played upon by their natural
environments,&mdash;sunlight and wind, and the chill at midnight
under the vault of starry space. There are other surroundings
also, where they will be subjected to chromatic action of
different lights, to invisible rays, to electrified ground or
thunder-charged atmosphere. Everywhere they will transcribe in
their own script the history of their experience. From this lofty
point of observation, sheltered by the trees, the student will
watch this panorama of life. Isolated from all distractions, he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id=
"Page_212">[Pg_212]</a></span>will learn to attune himself with
Nature; the obscuring veil will be lifted and he will gradually
come to see how community throughout the great ocean of life
outweighs apparent dissimilarity. Out of discord he will realise
the great harmony.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
THE OUTLOOK</p>
<p class="indent">These are the dreams that wove a network round
my wakeful life for many years past. The outlook is endless, for
the goal is at infinity. The realisation cannot be through one
life or one fortune but through the co-operation of many lives
and many fortunes. The possibility of a fuller expansion will
depend on very large endowments. But a beginning must be made,
and this is the genesis of the foundation of this Institute. I
came with nothing and shall return as I came; if something is
accomplished in the interval, that would indeed be a privilege.
What I have I will offer, and one who had shared with me the
struggles and hardships that had to be faced, has wished to
bequeath all that is hers for the same object. In all my
struggling efforts I have not been altogether solitary while the
world doubted, there had been a few, now in the City of Silence,
who never wavered in their trust.</p>
<p class="indent">Till a few weeks ago it seemed that I shall
have to look to the future for securing the necessary expansion
of scope and for permanence of the <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg_213]</a></span>Institute. But
response is being awakened in answer to the need. The Government
have most generously intimated their desire to sanction grants
towards placing the Institute on a permanent basis the extent of
which will be proportionate to the public interest in this
national undertaking. Out of many who would feel an interest in
securing adequate Endowment, the very first donations have come
from two of the merchant princes of Bombay, to whom I had been
personally unknown.</p>
<p class="indent">A note that touched me deeply came from some
girl students of the Western Province, enclosing their little
contribution "for the service of our common motherland." It is only the instinctive
mother-heart that can truly realise the bond that draws together
the nurselings of the common homeland.
There can be no real misgiving for the future when at the
country's call man offers the strength of his life and woman her
active devotion, she most of all, who has the greater insight and
larger faith because of the life of austerity and
self-abnegation. Even a solitary wayfarer in the Himalayas has
remembered to send me message of cheer and good hope. What is it
that has bridged over the distance and blotted out all
differences? That I will come gradually to know; till then it
will remain enshrined as a feeling. And I go forward to my
appointed task, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id=
"Page_214">[Pg_214]</a></span>undismayed by difficulties,
companioned by the kind thoughts of my well-wishers, both far and
near.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
INDIA'S SPECIAL APTITUDES IN CONTRIBUTION TO SCIENCE</p>
<p class="indent">The excessive specialisation of modern science
in the West has led to the danger of losing sight of the
fundamental fact that there can be but one truth, one science
which includes all the branches of knowledge. How chaotic appear
the happenings in Nature? Is nature a Cosmos! in which the human
mind is some day to realise the uniform march of sequence, order
and law? India through her habit of mind is peculiarly fitted to
realise the idea of unity, and to see in the phenomenal world an
orderly universe. This trend of thought led me unconsciously to
the dividing frontiers of different sciences and shaped the
course of my work in its constant alternations between the
theoretical and the practical, from the investigation of the
inorganic world to that of organised life and its multifarious
activities of growth, of movement, and even of sensation. On
looking over a hundred and fifty different lines of
investigations carried on during the last twenty-three years, I
now discover in them a natural sequence. The study of Electric
Waves led to the devising of methods for the production of the
shortest electric waves known and these bridged <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id=
"Page_215">[Pg_215]</a></span>over the gulf between visible and
invisible light; from this followed accurate investigation on the
optical properties of invisible waves, the determination of the
refractive powers of various opaque substances, the discovery of
effect of air film on total reflection and the polarising
properties of strained rocks and of electric tourmalines. The
invention of a new type of self-recovering electric receiver made
of galena was the fore-runner of application of crystal detectors
for extending the range of wireless signals. In physical
chemistry the detection of molecular change in matter under
electric stimulation, led to a new theory of photographic action.
The fruitful theory of stereochemistry was strengthened by the
production of two kinds of artificial molecules, which like the
two kinds of sugar, rotated the polarised electric wave either to
the right or to the left. Again the 'fatigue' of my receivers led
to the discovery of universal sensitiveness inherent in matter as
shown by its electric response. It was next possible to study
this response in its modification under changing environment, of
which its exaltation under stimulants and its abolition under
poisons are among the most astonishing outward manifestations.
And as a single example of the many applications of this fruitful
discovery, the characteristics of an artificial retina gave a
clue to the unexpected discovery <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg_216]</a></span>of "binocular
alternation of vision" in man;&mdash;each eye thus supplements
its fellow by turns, instead of acting as a continuously yoked
pair, as hitherto believed.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
PLANT LIFE AND ANIMAL LIFE</p>
<p class="indent">In natural sequence to the investigations of
the response in 'inorganic' matter, has followed a prolonged
study of the activities of plant-life as compared with the
corresponding functioning of animal life. But since plants for
the most part seem motionless and passive, and are indeed limited
in their range of movement, special apparatus of extreme delicacy
had to be invented, which should magnify the tremor of excitation
and also measure the perception period of a plant to a thousandth
part of a second. Ultra-microscopic movements were measured and
recorded; the length measured being often smaller than a fraction
of a single wave-length of light. The secret of plant life was
thus for the first time revealed by the autographs of the plant
itself. This evidence of the plant's own script removed the
long-standing error which divided the
vegetable world into sensitive and insensitive. The remarkable
performance of the Praying Palm Tree of Faridpore, which bows, as
if to prostrate itself, every evening, is only one of the latest
instances which show that the supposed insensibility of plants
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id=
"Page_217">[Pg_217]</a></span>and still more of rigid tree is to
be ascribed to wrong theory and defective observation. My
investigations show that all plants, even the trees, are fully
alive to changes of environment; they respond visibly to all
stimuli, even to the slight fluctuations of light caused by a
drifting cloud. This series of investigations has completely
established the fundamental identity of life-reactions in plant
and animal, as seen in a similar periodic insensibility in both,
corresponding to what we call sleep; as seen in the death-spasm,
which takes place in the plant as in the animal. This unity in
organic life is also exhibited in that
spontaneous pulsation which in the animal is heart-beat; it
appears in the identical effects of stimulants, anaesthetics and
of poisons in vegetable and animal tissues. This physiological
identity in the effect of drugs is regarded by leading physicians
as of great significance in the scientific advance of Medicine;
since here we have a means of testing the effect of drugs under
conditions far simpler than those presented by the patient far
subtler too, as well as more humane than those of experiments on
animals.</p>
<p class="indent">Growth of plants and its variations under
different treatment is instantly recorded by my Crescograph.
Authorities expect this method of investigation will advance
practical agriculture; since for the first time we are able to
analyse and study separately the <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg_218]</a></span>conditions which
modify the rate of growth. Experiments which would have taken
months and their results vitiated by unknown changes, can now be
carried out in a few minutes.</p>
<p class="indent">Returning to pure science, no phenomena in
plant life are so extremely varied or have yet been more
incapable of generalisation than the "tropic" movements, such as
the twining of tendrils, the heliotropic movements of some
towards and of others away from light, and the opposite geotropic
movements of the root and shoot, in the direction of gravitation
or away from it. My latest investigations recently communicated
to the Royal Society have established a single fundamental
reaction which underlies all these effects so extremely
diverse.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, I may say a word of that other new and
unexpected chapter which is opening out from my demonstration of
nervous impulse in plants. The speed with which the nervous
impulse courses through the plant has been determined; its
nervous excitability and the variation of that excitability have
likewise been measured. The nervous impulse in plant and in man
is found exalted or inhibited under identical conditions. We may
even follow this parallelism in what may seem extreme cases. A
plant carefully protected under glass from outside shocks, looks
sleek and flourishing; but its higher nervous function is then
found to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id=
"Page_219">[Pg_219]</a></span>be atrophied. But when a succession
of blows is rained on this effect and bloated specimen, the
shocks themselves create nervous channels and arouse anew the
deteriorated nature. And is it not shocks of adversity, and not
cotton-wool protection, that evolve true manhood?</p>
<p class="indent">A question long perplexing physiologists and
psychologists alike is that concerned with the great mystery that
underlies memory. But now through certain experiments I have
carried out, it is possible to trace "memory impressions"
backwards even in inorganic matter, such latent impressions being
capable of subsequent revival. Again the tone of our sensation is
determined by the intensity of nervous excitation that reaches
the central perceiving organ. It would theoretically be possible
to change the tone or quality of our sensation, if means could be
discovered by which the nervous impulse would become modified
during transit. Investigation on nervous impulse in plants has
led to the discovery of a controlling method, which was found
equally effective in regard to the nervous impulse in animal.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus the lines of physics, of physiology and of
psychology converge and meet. And here will assemble those who
would seek oneness amidst the manifold. Here it is that the
genius of India should find its true blossoming.</p>
<p class="indent">The thrill in matter, the throb of life, the
pulse of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id=
"Page_220">[Pg_220]</a></span>growth, the impulse coursing
through the nerve and the resulting sensations, how diverse are
these and yet how unified! How strange it is that the tremor of
excitation in nervous matter should not merely be transmitted but
transmuted and reflected like the image on a mirror, from a
different plane of life, in sensation and in affection, in
thought and in emotion. Of these which is more real, the material
body or the image which is independent of it? Which of these is
undecaying, and which of these is beyond the reach of death?</p>
<p class="indent">It was a woman in the Vedic times, who when
asked to take her choice of the wealth that would be hers for the
asking, inquired whether that would win for her deathlessness.
What would she do with it, if it did not raise her above death?
This has always been the cry of the soul of India, not for
addition of material bondage, but to work out through struggle
her self-chosen destiny and win immortality. Many a nation had
risen in the past and won the empire of the world. A few buried
fragments are all that remain as memorials of the great dynasties
that wielded the temporal power. There is, however, another
element which find its incarnation in matter, yet transcends its
transmutation and apparent destruction: that is the burning flame
born of thought which has been handed down through fleeting
generations.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id=
"Page_221">[Pg_221]</a></span>Not in matter, but in thought, not
in possessions or even in attainments but in ideals, are to be
found the seed of immortality. Not through material acquisition
but in generous diffusion of ideas and ideals can the true empire
of humanity be established. Thus to Asoka to whom belonged this
vast empire, bounded by the inviolate seas, after he had tried to
ransom the world by giving away to the utmost, there came a time
when he had nothing more to give, except one half of an
<i>Amlaki</i> fruit. This was his last possession and anguished
cry was that since he had nothing more to give, let the half of
the <i>Amlaki</i> be accepted as his final gift.</p>
<p class="indent">Asoka's emblem of the <i>Amlaki</i> will be
seen on the cornices of the Institute, and towering above all is
the symbol of the thunderbolt. It was the Rishi Dadhichi, the
pure and blameless, who offered his life that the divine weapon,
the thunderbolt, might be fashioned out of his bones to smite
evil and exalt righteousness. It is but half of the <i>Amlaki</i>
that we can offer now. But the past shall be reborn in a yet
nobler future. We stand here to-day and resume work to-morrow so
that by the efforts of our lives and our unshaken faith in the
future we may all help to build the greater India yet to be.</p>

THE <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id=
"Page_222">[Pg_222]</a></span>PRAYING PALM OF FARIDPUR</p>
<p class="indent">Under the presidency of Lord Ronaldshay Sir J.
C. Bose delivered a lecture on Friday the 4th January 1918, at
the "Bose Institute" on 'The Praying Palm-tree.' He said:</p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps no phenomenon is so remarkable and
shrouded with greater mystery as the performances of a particular
palm tree near Faridpore. In the evening while the temple bells
ring calling upon people to prayer, this tree bows down as if
prostrate itself. It erects its head again in the morning, and
this process is repeated every day during the year. This
extraordinary phenomenon has been regarded as miraculous, and
pilgrims have been attracted in great numbers. It is alleged that
offerings made to the tree, that is to say to the custodian of
the tree, have been the means effecting marvellous cures. It is
not necessary to pronounce any opinion on the subject; these
cures may be taken as effective as other faith cures now so
fashionable in the West.</p>
<p class="indent">I first obtained photographs of the two
positions which proved the phenomenon to be real. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id=
"Page_223">[Pg_223]</a></span>next thing was to devise special
apparatus to record continuously the movement of the tree day and
night. But difficulties were encountered in getting the consent
of the proprietor to attach foreign instruments to the sacred
tree. His misgivings were however removed when it was explained
that the instruments were pure Swadeshi, being made in my
Laboratory. The records of the Palm Tree showed that it fell with
the rise of temperature, and rose with the fall. Records obtained
with other trees brought out the extraordinary and unsuspected
fact that all trees are moving&mdash;such movements being in
response to changes in their environment.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
SENSITIVE OR INSENSITIVE?</p>
<p class="indent">That not a "Mimosa" alone, but all plants are
sensitive was demonstrated by some striking experiments. A spiral
tendril, under electric shock was shown
to writhe imitating the contortions of a tortured worm. In
ordinary plants, all sides being equally sensitive contraction
takes place on all directions with resulting neutral effect.
Another striking experiment was to show how ordinary plants could
be made sensitive by the mere process of amputation of the
balancing half? Further experiments were shown demonstrating the
effects of light, of warmth and other stimuli on the plant.
Warmth worked antagonistically to light. The <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id=
"Page_224">[Pg_224]</a></span>numerous permutations brought about
by two changing variations were shown by a mechanical hand, which
traced most complicated curves. In actual life the number of
changing factors are very numerous, hence the intricacy involved
in the manifestations of life.</p>
<p class="indent">The experiments that have been shown will help
the audience to realise in some measure that the world we live in
is not a theatre of caprice or chance, but that an all pervading
law holds and regulates its destiny. We have seen that the vast
expanse of life which is unvoiced, seemingly, so impassive, is
instinct with sensibility. Thus the whole of the vegetable world,
including rigid trees perceive the changes in their environment
and respond to them by unmistakable signals. They thrill under
light and become depressed by darkness; the warmth of summer and
frost of winter, drought and rain, these and
many other happenings leave a subtle impression on the life of
the plant. By invention of apparatus of extreme delicacy, it is
possible to make the plant itself write down the history of its
own experience in a hieroglyphic which it is possible to
decipher. From these pages, taken from the diary of the plant, it
will perhaps be possible some day to get an insight into the
great mystery that surrounds life itself. For I shall in the
course of lectures given here show how the life of plants is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id=
"Page_225">[Pg_225]</a></span>a mere reflection of our own. I
shall show how shocks and wounds affect them as they affect
animals; how a common death-throb marks the crisis when life
passes into death. The exuberance of life, on the other hand,
will be shown by pulsing throbs of animal's heart and spontaneous
beat in vegetal tissues. Another aspect of this exuberance will
be shown in the imperceptible growth of plants. My recently
invented Crescograph, to be exhibited at my lecture a fortnight
hence, will magnify growth a million-fold and record ultra
microscopic movements, smaller than a single wave length of
light. By this apparatus growth will be instantaneously recorded
and conditions which foster or inhibit growth discriminated. I
shall demonstrate my discovery of the nervous system in plants,
and show how shocks from without pass within, and how this
nervous impulse modified during transit. It will further be shown
how various stimulants, anesthetics
and poison induce effects which are identical in man and in
plant. It will be obvious how these studies will open new fields
of inquiry in different branches of science; in Physiology and Psychology; in Medicine and in
Agriculture.</p>

VISUALISATION <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id=
"Page_226">[Pg_226]</a></span>OF GROWTH</p>
<p class="indent">Sir J. C. Bose delivered on the 18th January
1918, at the Bose Institute, the second of the series of
discourses on revelations of plant life. This time the audience
had the opportunity of witnessing the working of Bose's newly
perfected Crescograph which is undoubtedly one of the marvels in
modern Science. For this apparatus gives a visual demonstration
of movements which are far beyond the highest powers of
microscope. The invisible internal workings of life are thus for
the first time revealed to man.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
LAW VERSUS CAPRICE</p>
<p class="indent">The lecturer first described the infinite
variations in life reactions in plants. The same external
stimulus, he said apparently produces one effect in one plant;
and precisely opposite in another. Some leaves move towards light; others are repelled by it. The root
bends towards the centre of the earth, the shoot rises above away
from it. Numerous other "tropic" movements are caused by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id=
"Page_227">[Pg_227]</a></span>contact, by electricity, by
moisture and by invisible radiations. These effects appear so
extremely diverse and capricious that some of the leading
physiologists were forced to come to the conclusion that there
was no law guiding such movement, but that the plant decides for
itself what should be the effect of external conditions on
it.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
RECORD OF GROWTH</p>
<p class="indent">Most of these tropic movements are brought
about by changes induced in growth by the action of different
forces. But growth is so excessively slow that slight changes
induced in it is impossible of detection. The proverbially slow
paced snail moves two thousand times faster than the growing
point of a plant. Hence to visualise growth and its changes,
apparatus has to be invented which would magnify growth something
like a million times. If such a thing were possible the pace of
the snail would be quickened to the speed of a rifle bullet. The
difficulties in connection with the devising and construction of
apparatus with this extraordinary power appeared at first an
impossibility. The Jewels for the fittings of the apparatus could
not be found fine enough. The lecturer had to discard ordinary
jewels for diamonds, such bearings being only made in Germany.
But the outbreak of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228"
id="Page_228">[Pg_228]</a></span>war put an end to this source of
supply. He had then to turn to resources available in India.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
ADVANCE OF AGRICULTURE</p>
<p class="indent">The invention of method for immediate record of
growth and its variations under various conditions is one of
immense practical importance. Experiments on gigantic scales are
in progress all over the world for this purpose. At Rothamstead,
this work has been going on for more than half a century. The
great Department of Agriculture in Mashington spends millions
every year on such experiments, there being a thousand men
employed in research. Recently many experiments have been
undertaken on the effect of electricity on growth. The results
obtained have been mostly contradictory. For real advance in
agriculture we must first discover the laws of growth. Ordinary
experiments on growth are of little value because they take weeks
for detecting changes of growth which might have been brought
about by charges in the environment. The only satisfactory method
is to devise an apparatus which would make the plant itself
record the rate of its growth, and the changes induced by food or
treatment in the course of less than a minute, during which short
time it is possible to maintain external conditions constant.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
THE <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id=
"Page_229">[Pg_229]</a></span>MAGNETIC CRESCOGRAPH</p>
<p class="indent">All the difficulties connected with the
devising of apparatus has been completely removed by the
lecturer's successful invention of his new magnetic crescograph
in which practically unlimited magnification is obtained without
the difficulties arising from the unavoidable friction of
bearings. Magnetic forces are so exactly balanced that a
disturbance in the balance caused by slightest movements such as
that of growth is magnified ten millions of times. The
application of this new principle will be of great importance in
various investigations in Physics.</p>
<p class="indent">Sir J. C. Bose next demonstrated some
marvellous results obtained with his apparatus. A seedling which
on account of the Winter season appeared stationary jotted down
by taps on a moving plate, the rate of its growth. The
application of a chemical instantly arrested this growth, but an
antidote timely applied, not only removed the torpor but enhanced
the growth at an enormous rate. The life of the plant became
pliant at the will of the experimenter, and nothing appeared more
marvellous than the realisation that man has the power to pierce
the veil that shrouds the mystery that had hitherto baffled
him.</p>
<p class="indent">The lecturer explained how the effect of a
given agent&mdash;a chemical solution or an electric
current&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id=
"Page_230">[Pg_230]</a></span>is profoundly modified by the dose
a given intensity, producing one effect and a different intensity
giving rise to an effect diametrically opposite. This is the
reason of the inexplicable anomalies which have baffled many
investigators. Numerous are the forces which act on growth some
helping, others retarding, the effects being further modified by
the strength and duration of application. These factors that
determine growth are each to be studied in detail, and the laws
of effect of each to be discovered. There can be no real advance
in scientific agriculture until this is done.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a brilliant gathering at the Royal
Opera House on Tuesday the 22nd January 1918, when Sir Jagadis
Bose gave a deeply interesting lecture on
the history of the inception of his Institute in Calcutta and its
aims together with an exposition of his scientific researches
illustrated by lantern slides. The theatre was full long before
the lecture commenced and several prominent people were present
the bulk of the audience consisting of Indians.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Tilak in introducing the distinguished
lecturer to the audience referred to Professor Bose's lasting
services not only to the Indian nation but to the whole world.
These references to Dr. Bose and his work elicited frequent
applause from the large audience.</p>

A FIFTY THOUSAND RUPEES LECTURE.</p>
<p class="indent">Sir Jagadis, who was accorded a most
enthusiastic ovation on rising to address the gathering,
acknowledged his gratitude to the public of Bombay who proved
their appreciation of his work by their <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id=
"Page_232">[Pg_232]</a></span>presence there that evening, and
the fact that they had subscribed Rs. 50,000 for the occasion. He
then gave a brief explanatory account of the nature and scope of
his work, which he had planned and carried out alone for many
years amidst many and varied difficulties. He gave an exposition
by the aid of one of the delicate instruments of his own
invention of how plants respond to various sounds and tunes and
the beautiful colour display which was observed in this
connection appeared as though he were a magician with a wand.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
PLANTS UNDER ANAESTHETICS</p>
<p class="indent">The Doctor explained the meaning and
significance of the thunderbolt which
has been adopted as the symbol of the institution. He explained
also the special uses to which the various parts of the buildings
would be put. The fact was brought out that the entire building
and grounds had been designed to suit the special needs of the
Institute and care had been taken to make it as far as possible
self contained. An interesting feature of the garden close to
that portion which forms the residence of Sir Jagadis was the
open platform perched above two trees, transplanted under
anaesthetic conditions. A variety of apparatus is
displayed under these trees and the platform is intended for
observation or meditation or both. Dr. Bose here explained
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id=
"Page_233">[Pg_233]</a></span>how trees when transplanted
frequently died under the shock of the operation just as human
being sometimes died, not from an operation but from the shock
caused thereby. Similarly he had discovered and proved that trees
could, like human beings, go through severe operations and
survive the shock, if placed under the influence of an
anaesthetic.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
SOME PHENOMENA OF PLANT LIFE</p>
<p class="indent">The Professor explained next other experiments
which he had performed on plants and whose results had exhibited
the close parallel which plant life bears to human life. With the
aid of another delicate instrument he showed how the growth of
plants can be influenced by drugs and the demonstration on the
screen of the manner in which the slow growth of a plant can be
thus expedited was one of extraordinary interest. One was able to
see the flame of life moving up the screen and recording at
intervals the stages of growth, a lengthening of the intervals
between each recorded glow illustrating the acceleration of
growth as soon as the drug was applied. The instruments necessary
to record this phenomenon are of extraordinary delicacy, and
barely survived the strain of the journey from Calcutta.</p>

ELECTRICITY <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id=
"Page_234">[Pg_234]</a></span>AND AGRICULTURE</p>
<p class="indent">The last experiment was in regard to the effect
of electricity on plant life. He referred particularly to the
fact that it was his aim to discover the law of growth and
atrophy among plants. Such a discovery had a great bearing on the
future of agriculture and would revolutionise world thought.
Electricity, he explained and illustrated, would promote or
retard the growth of life by reaction. In England and other
countries electricity had been applied to agriculture but without
exact knowledge of its varying effect on plant life. He then
showed by another apparatus of extreme delicacy that electricity
might retard and even repel as well as promote the growth of
plant life. But if the law of growth and decay could be
ascertained, it was possible to regulate the control of life
under most varied conditions.</p>

UNITY <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id=
"Page_235">[Pg_235]</a></span>OF LIFE</p>
<p class="indent">Under the auspices of the Bombay University,
Sir Jagadis Chundar Bose delivered on
Thursday, the 31st January 1918, a lecture on the "Unity of
Life." It was illustrated by lantern slides and an instructive
exposition was given of some of his unique discoveries in the
realm of Plant Life....</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
HIDDEN HISTORY IN PLANTS LIFE</p>
<p class="indent">"The subject of my address to-night is the
'Unity of Life.' Under a placid exterior there is a hidden
history on the life of the plant. Is it possible to make the
plants write down their own autographs and thus reveal their
history? In order to succeed in this we have first to discover
some compulsive force which will make the plant give an answering
signal, secondly, we have to invent some instrument of extreme
delicacy for the automatic conversion of these signals into an
intelligent script; and last of all, we have ourselves to learn
the nature of the hieroglyphics."</p>
<p class="indent">Sir J. C. Bose then explained the principle of
his epoch-making Resonant Recorder which
writes <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id=
"Page_236">[Pg_236]</a></span>down the perception period of the
plant within a thousandth part of a second, and writes down the
action of light and warmth and drugs on the plant; the effect of
vitiated air, of passing clouds, of excess of food and of
drink.</p>
<p class="indent">"The plant is very human in its virtues and
weakness. Plants like animals become exalted, grow tired or
despond. An easy green-house life makes them less than
themselves, overgrown and flabby, capable of response, till they
have become hardened by adversity to a fuller existence. A time
comes when after an answer to a supreme shock, there is a sudden
end of the plant's power to give any further response. This
supreme shock is the shock of death. Even in this crisis there is
no immediate change in the placid appearance of the plant.
Drooping and withering are events that occur long after death
itself. How does the plant then give its last answer? In man at
the critical moment a spasm passes through the whole body and
similarly in the plant I find a great contractile spasm takes
place. This is accompanied by an electrical spasm also. In the
script of the Death Recorder the line that up to this time was
being drawn, become suddenly reversed and then ends. This is the
last answer of the plant.</p>
<p class="indent">"These our mute companions, silently growing
beside our door, have now told us the tale of their <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id=
"Page_237">[Pg_237]</a></span>life-tremulousness and their
death-spasm in script that is as inarticulate as they. May it not
be said that this story has a pathos of its own beyond any that
we may have conceived?</p>
<p class="indent">"We have now before our mind's eye the whole
organism of the perceiving, throbbing and responding plant, a
complex unity and not a congeries of unrelated parts. The
barriers which separated kindred phenomena in the plant and
animal are now thrown down. Thus community throughout the great
ocean of life is seen to outweigh apparent dissimilarity
Diversity is swallowed up in unity.</p>
<p class="indent">"In realising this, is our sense of final
mystery of things deepened or lessened? Is our sense of wonder
diminished when we realise in the infinite expanse of life that
is silent and voiceless the foreshadowings of more wonderful
complexities? Is it not rather that science evokes in us a deeper
sense of awe? Does not each of her new advances gain for us a
step in that stairway of rock which all must climb who desire to
look from the mountain tops of the spirit upon the promised land
of truth?"</p>
<p class="indent">Sir Jagadis then gave a most interesting
exposition of his researches with the aid of magic lantern
slides.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
SENSITIVENESS IN PLANTS</p>
<p class="indent">Referring first of all his discovery of
sensitiveness <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id=
"Page_238">[Pg_238]</a></span>in plants, he said that in that
respect they were akin to the human system. He illustrated this
truth by a demonstration of the reaction that takes place in the
frog when a shock is communicated and side by side presenting the
reaction that is similarly effected in the plant. "Plants have a
nervous system like our own," he said, and with the aid of an
enlarged illustration of the mimosa he showed the changes that
took place when the plant was disturbed. Turning to plant
autograph, he spoke of the Resonant Recorder, a special apparatus
which he has invented to prove how even plants are tuned to
environment. Certain tunes had no effect on plants, he said,
while others had and he asked them specially to observe the
beautiful and variegated colour formation produced by their
response to tunes. He gave an interesting experiment on this
point, and both Lord and Lady Willingdon tried it. There was a
great outburst of cheering, which was renewed each time the
effect was produced, and it was noticed that the cheering, which
was vociferous had its own effect. It had taken him a long time,
he said, to produce and perfect the complete apparatus to
determine the latent mimosa and by the aid of that apparatus, he
was able to record the movement of the plant to one thousandth of
a second.</p>
<p class="indent">He next went on to say that all plants were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id=
"Page_239">[Pg_239]</a></span>endowed like ourselves, but at
first the news was received with great scepticism. He did not
despair, however, of success and was continuously engaged in
discovering, in collecting fresh evidence. Thanks to the action
of the Government of India in sending him on a world tour, he got
at last the opportunity to prove before the scientific societies
of the world, the truth of his discoveries. An illustration of
the Mimosa which has accompanied him in his world tour was
screened.</p>
<p class="indent">The next illustration was to show how long
plants took to feel shock and what time they took to recover.
Like the great human system plants were subject to periodic
conscianimal [<i>sic.</i>, consciousness?] had their periods of
sleep and awakening. The extra water pressure produced during
sunset had nothing to do with true sleep. Plants, too, were
subject to exaltation and depression and at certain hours of the
day they were fully conscious and active while at other hours
they were dormant and lazy. He showed by means of a chart that
they were fast asleep between 6 and 9 in the morning and his
humorous remark that in that respect they had taken a leaf from
our modern society ladies provoked a great deal of laughter. A
series of records were then shown to illustrate the various
degrees of plant consciousness, which were deeply appreciated by
the audience.</p>
<p class="indent">Proceeding Dr. Bose said that plants were far
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id=
"Page_240">[Pg_240]</a></span>more conscious of nature than human
beings and described his experience how plants were sensitive
even to passing clouds, which produced on them a depressing
effect. He spoke of the difference between thin and wiry grown
plants and those that were stout and robust. In that respect they
resembled again human beings and thin and wiry grown plants were
far more susceptible of excitement than the others. They, too,
needed rest and without it, they were flabby and depressed. A
cartoon from the London "Punch" entitled "A successful Trial" was
screened to the merriment of the audience, in which the Professor
was humorously depicted by that journal, after his exposition
before the Royal Institute in London. He gave an illustration of
the "Praying Palm of Faridpur" and the changes it exhibited to
environment. All plants displayed similar power and these changes
were no longer inscrutable. They had been brought within the
realm of scrutability [<i>sic.</i>] and could be recorded.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
"PROTECTING" PLANTS</p>
<p class="indent">It was a mistake to suppose that when
"protected" plants would thrive better. Mothers had a tendency to
keep their children away from contact with the outside world with
a view to "protect" them. He had placed a plant under a glass
case and the effect of it was he had a gloated and effete
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id=
"Page_241">[Pg_241]</a></span>specimen, flabby-looking in appearance and weary under
adversity, they recovered sooner and their growth was healthy
just as it evolved true manhood in men. It had been commonly
believed that carbonic acid gas was conducive to plant growth.
That was a great mistake. In sunshine, plants readily absorbed
it; but it was no more true that plants thrived on CO<sub>2</sub>, than did
human beings. He illustrated the effect of carbonic acid gas as
well as oxygen. The latter was as much necessary for plants to
thrive on as it was for them. Another illustration exhibited the
effect of alcohol on plants and he declared amidst laughter that
alcohol produced the same alternate maudlin depression and
exaltation on plants that is to be observed on the human system.
He said that this experiment had tickled the Americans a great
deal and referred to a conversation he had with Mr. Bryan, who
was a teetotaller, regarding alcohol
given to plants. Some American papers had given characteristic
headlines to introduce his lecture on the effect of stimulus to
plants.</p>
<p class="indent">Another plant Desmodium which has accompanied
him in his world tour was filmed on the screen. He spoke, next,
of the apparatus which he had invented to record plant pulsation
and the struggle they exhibited between life and death. Poisons
had as much effect on plants as on men, and they <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id=
"Page_242">[Pg_242]</a></span>could be revived by applying
antidotes, this was illustrated by another chart. Another point
of interest dealt with by him was the effect of warm water on
plants, and he gave an exposition of his discovery to show that
plants died when placed in 60 degree (centigrade) warm water. He
referred to the stupendous phenomenon of invisible writing by
means of which the plant recorded its own evolution.</p>
<p class="indent">The lecture was listened to with profound
interest and lasted for an hour. Mr. Setalvad proposed a hearty
vote of thanks to the Chancellor for presiding at the meeting.
Lord Willingdon, in acknowledging it, said that the vote of
thanks was due to Sir Jagadis rather than to himself. As he had
anticipated in the beginning, the lecture had proved absorbingly
interesting and he was afraid Sir Jagadis's discoveries might be
positively alarming when he next visited Bombay. He hoped that
they would accord Sir Jagadis a hearty vote of thanks with "true
Bombay cordiality." After a few suitable remarks by Sir Jagadis
the meeting terminated.</p>

essential unity in spite of deceptive appearance to the contrary.
He had recently been on a visit to the western Presidency, he
went there as a stranger, but he has come back with a pang at
parting from kindreds. Never in his life did he realise so
vividly as now the great unity that drew together all who
regarded India as their home and place of work. They were bound
to each other by mutual ties of dependence. He had for many years
been engaged in discovering community in physical manifestations
of life. Now he has realised an abiding unity in the highest
manifestations of human life, in community of thoughts and

"Page_244">[Pg_244]</a></span>In the wide expanse of life itself
few things would appear so strikingly different as the life
activities in plants and in animals. But if in spite of the
seeming differences, it could be proved that these life
activities are fundamentally similar, this would undoubtedly
constitute a scientific generalisation of very great importance.
It would then follow that the complex mechanism of the animal
machine, that baffled us so long, need not remain inscrutable for
all time, for the intricate problems of animal physiology would
then naturally find their solution in the study of corresponding
problems under simpler conditions of vegetative life. That would
mean an enormous advance in the science of physiology, of
agriculture, of medicine, and even of psychology.</p>
<p class="indent">How then are we to know what unseen changes
take place within the plant? The only conceivable way would be,
if that were possible, to detect and measure the actual response
of the organism to a definite testing blow. When an animal
receives an external shock it may answer in various ways; If it
has voice, by a cry, if dumb, by the movement of its limbs. The
external shock is the stimulus, the answer of the organism is the
response. If we can make it give some tangible response to a
questioning shock, then we can judge the condition of the plant
by the extent of the answer. In an excitable condition the
feeblest stimulus will evoke an extraordinarily <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id=
"Page_245">[Pg_245]</a></span>large response, in a depressed
state even a strong stimulus evokes only a feeble response, and
lastly, when death has overcome life, there is an abrupt end of
the power to answer at all.</p>
<p class="indent">Prof. Bose then explained the principle and
action of his apparatus by which the plant attached to it is
automatically excited by successive stimuli which are absolutely
constant. In answer to this the plant makes its own responsive
records, goes through its own period of recovery, and embarks on
the same cycle over again without assistance from the observer at
any point. In this way the effect of changed external conditions
is seen recorded in the script made by the plant itself.</p>
<p class="indent">It has been thought that plants like mimosa
alone were sensitive. But Sir J. C. Bose's apparatus demonstrated
the unsuspected fact that every plant and every organ of every
plant answered to a shock by a contractile spasm, as by an animal
muscle. If perception of feeble stimulus be taken as a measure of
ascent in the scale of life then the superiority of man must be
established on a foundation more secure than sensibility. The
most sensitive organ by which we can detect electric current is
our tongue. An average European can perceive a current as feeble
as six micro-amperes, a micro-ampere being a millionth part of
the electric unit. Possibly the tongue of a Celt is more
excitable, and I have <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246"
id="Page_246">[Pg_246]</a></span>no doubt that my countrymen can
easily boast the Celt in this particular test. But the plant
mimosa is ten times more excitable than the tongue of an advocate
in this province.</p>
<p class="indent">Professor Bose then showed how identical were
the effects of light, warmth and various drugs on the plant and
animal. These experiments bring the plant much nearer than we
ever thought. We find that it is not a mere
mass of vegetative growth, but that its every fibre is instinct
with sensibility. We are able to record the throbbings of its
pulsating life, and find these wax and wane according to the life
conditions of the plant, and cease in the death of the organism.
In these and many other ways the life reactions in plant and man
are alike, and thus through the experience of the plant, it may
be possible to alleviate the sufferings of man.</p>

CONTROL <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id=
"Page_247">[Pg_247]</a></span>OF NERVOUS IMPULSE</p>
<p class="indent">At the first anniversary meeting of the Bose
institute, held on the 30th November 1918, Sir J. C. Bose gave
the following discourse on his recent discoveries relating to the
question of control of nervous impulse, under the Presidency of
His Excellency Lord Ronaldshay, Governor of Bengal.</p>
<p class="indent">It is one of the greatest of all mysteries how
we are put in connection with the external world: how blows from
without are felt within. Our organs of sensation are like so many
antennae radiating in various directions
and picking up messages of many kinds. All
of these, when analysed to their utmost, consist of shock effects
on different chords. An extremely feeble stimulus is below the
limit of perception, a moderate stimulus transmits excitation,
which is perceived as sensation of not an unpleasant character,
but the tone of sensation becomes painful when the excitation is
very intense. Our sensation is thus coloured by the intensity of
the nervous excitation that reaches the central organ. We are
subject to human limitations, through the imperfection of our
senses on the one hand, and <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg_248]</a></span>over-sensibility on
the other. There are happenings which elude us because the
impinging stimulus is too feeble to waken our senses; the
external shock, on the other hand, may be so intense as to fill
our life with pain.</p>
<p class="indent">Since we have no direct power over the shocks
which come to us from the outside world, is it possible to
control the nervous impulse so that it should be exalted in one
case, and inhibited or obliterated in the other? Does advance of
science hold any such</p>
possibility? This question is plainly fraught with high
significance.
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
PROBLEM OF CONTROL OF NERVOUS IMPULSE</p>
<p class="indent">Before proceeding further it will be necessary
first to obtain a clear idea of the function of a nervous tissue
and its characteristics; secondly the manner, in which the
nervous impulse is propagated; and lastly, we have to discover
some compulsive force by which the impulse may be intensified or
inhibited during transit. The nerve circuit may be liked to an
electric circuit, and invisible impulse bringing about response
in the indicator, be it the brain or the galvanometer.
In the electric circuit the
conducting power of the metallic wire is constant, and the
intensity of the electric impulse depends on the intensity of the
electric force applied. If the conducting power of <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg_249]</a></span>the
nerve were constant then the intensity of the nervous impulse and
its resulting sensation would depend inevitably on the intensity
of the shock from outside which starts the impulse. In that case
the possibility of the modification of our sensation would be an
impossibility. But there may be a likelihood that the power of
conduction possessed by a nerve is not constant but capable of
change. Should this surmise prove to be correct then we arrive at
the momentous conclusion that sensation itself is modifiable,
whatever the external stimulus. For the modification of nervous
impulse there remains only one alternative; namely, some power to
render the vehicle a very much better conductor or a
non-conductor according to particular requirements. We require
the nervous path to the supra-conducting to have the impulse due
to feeble stimulus brought to sensory prominence. When the external blow is too violent we would block
the painful impulse by rendering the nerve a non-conductor.</p>
<p class="indent">Under narcotic the nerve becomes paralysed and
we can by its use save ourselves from pain. But such heroic
measures are to be resorted to in extreme cases, as when we are
under the surgeon's knife. In actual life we are confronted with
unpleasantness without notice. A telephone subscriber has an
evident advantage, for he can switch <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg_250]</a></span>off
the connection when the message begins to be unpleasant.
Statesmen or politicians have been known to cultivate convenient
deafness; but that is a mere pretence. The unpleasant things
heard, would still continue to rankle. It is not every one that
has the courage of Mr. Herbert Spencer who openly resorted to his
ear plugs whenever his visitor became tedious.</p>
<p class="indent">The lecturer then explained that the
propagation of nervous impulse is a phenomenon of transmission of
molecular disturbance. It occurred to him that the transmission
could be controlled if he succeeded in discovering a compulsive
force which would confer on the conducting particles two opposite
molecular dispositions, one of which would exalt and the other
resist the impulse. His experiments were first conducted with the
primitive type of nerve which he had previously discovered in
plants. In full confirmation of his theory, he succeeded in
conferring on the nervous tissue two opposite dispositions. Under
favourable disposition the nerve is rendered supra-conducting;
subliminal stimulus now becomes fully perceived. Under the
opposite molecular disposition the violent impulse due to
excessive stimulus becomes weakened or arrested during transit,
and the plant remains quite unaffected by the external shock.</p>
<p class="indent">The lecturer has in his previous works
demonstrated <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id=
"Page_251">[Pg_251]</a></span>the unity of life-reactions in the
plant and animal. A climax is now reached when by the application
of identical treatment he is able to confer alternately on the
same animal nerve, supra-conducting or non-conducting property at
will. Under a particular molecular disposition the experimental
frog perceived and responded to stimulus which had hitherto been
below its threshold of perception. Under the opposite disposition
violent tetanic spasm caused by the irritant salt applied to the
nerve became at once quelled. The normal property of the nerve
was at once restored on the withdrawal of the predisposing
force.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
MAN VICTORIOUS OVER CIRCUMSTANCE</p>
<p class="indent">Thus by the control of molecular disposition of
the conducting nerve, nervous impulse, and the resulting
sensation may become profoundly modified. The external is not so
overwhelmingly dominant, and man is not to be merely passive in
the hands of destiny. There is a latent power which would raise
him above the terrors of his inimical surroundings. It remains
with him that the channels through which the outside world reach
him should, at his command be widened or become closed. It may
thus be possible for him to catch those indistinct messages that
had hitherto eluded him or he may withdraw within himself, so
that in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id=
"Page_252">[Pg_252]</a></span>his inner realm, the jarring notes
and the din of the world should no longer affect him.</p>
<p class="indent">The whole audience heard the discourse with
spell bound interest. The Indian Scientist came to that
realisation by experiments at which the Indian Jogis of yore
arrived by intuition. Following an absolutely original line
inventing his own apparatus of the most simple yet subtle
delicacy and having constructed them by the hands of Indian
artisans, working without collaborators and with the smallest
modicum of recognition by his fellow scientists, he has pursued
his investigation to a result which has been a revelation to the
whole world. Dr. Bose has proved that man and plant are one body
and life in their physiology, in their vital habits and nervous
responses. He has clearly demonstrated that nervous life in the
plant responds to the same stimuli as in human beings. He has
established between animal and plant a unity of incipient mind.
The plant not only lives and dies, wakes and sleeps but it makes
the responses which in animal would be pleasure and pain.</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. Bose has made a great step towards the
unification of knowledge. A bridge has been built between man and
inert matter. Even if we take Dr. Bose's experiments with metals
in conjunctions with his experiments on plants, we may hold it to
be practically proved for the thinker that Life in <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id=
"Page_253">[Pg_253]</a></span>various degrees of manifestation
and organisation is omnipresent in Matter and is no foreign
introduction or accidental development, but was always that to be
evolved.</p>
<p class="indent">The ancient thinkers knew well that life and
mind exist everywhere in essence and vary only by the degree and
manner of their emergencies and functionings. All is in all and
it is out of complete involution that the complete evolution
progressively appears. It is only appropriate that for a
descendant of the race of ancient thinkers who formulated that
knowledge, should be reserved the privilege of initiating one of
the most important among the many discoveries by which
experimental science is confirming the wisdom of his
forefathers.</p>

MARVELS <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id=
"Page_254">[Pg_254]</a></span>OF GROWTH AS REVEALED BY THE
"MAGNETIC CRESCOGRAPH"</p>
<p class="indent">[Sir J. C. Bose has recently invented the
"Magnetic" crescograph. It is a supersensitive instrument and the
very high magnification obtained by it surpasses all existing
appliances. By this instrument, phenomena hitherto beyond the
reach of investigation can now be studied with great precision.
It shows ultra-microscopic changes
inducted in a growing organism even by a puff of smoke or a
gentle breeze, by a passing cloud or fleeting brightness. This
super magnifier was exhibited for the first time by Sir J. C.
Bose before an appreciative gathering 10-1-1919. A number of lady
students, professors, lawyers, doctors and several eminent
personages gathered to hear the great Indian scientist.]</p>
<p class="indent">In his Discourse on the above subject on
Friday, Sir J. C. Bose illustrated how the limitations imposed on
the advance of science by the imperfection of our senses, may
stimulate the invention of supersensitive apparatus which
reveals to us the existence of phenomena hitherto unknown. Thus
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id=
"Page_255">[Pg_255]</a></span>the invention of the microscope from a simple lens magnifying 3 or 4
times into progress up to 1500 diameters has
given birth to new sciences. But still higher magnification is
demanded in unravelling the mystery of
movements associated with the simplest type of life as seen in
plants. Greatest potentiality in life is often latent; the
gigantic banian tree grows out of a thing which is smaller than
the mustard seed. Within the seed-coat the dormant life remains
in safety, protected from dangers outside. The seeds may thus be
subjected without harm to cold so intense as will freeze mercury
into solid and air into liquid. Winds and hurricanes scatter the
seed of life and the cocoa-nut rides the
tumultuous waves till anchored safe in an island yet to be
inhabited. In due season there begins a series of most
astonishing transformations; the latent life wakens, and the
seedling begins to grow. The root turns downwards and the shoot
upwards. Underground, the root winds its way round stones and
obstacles towards moist places. Above ground the stem bends as if
in search of light. Tendrils twine about a support. These visible
movements are striking enough, but within the unruffled exterior
of the plant body there are others, energetic and incessant,
which escape our scrutiny. The bending of a growing organ towards
or away from stimulus must be due to unequal growth on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id=
"Page_256">[Pg_256]</a></span>two sides of the organ, a
retardation of growth on the proximal or acceleration on the
distant sides. Various theories have been advanced which have
proved inadequate. For the identical stimulus of gravity produces
one kind of curvature in the root and the very opposite in the
shoot. The possibility of direct experimental investigation has
been frustrated by the excessive slow rate of growth rendering
accurate measurement impossible.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
THE SLOWNESS OF GROWTH</p>
<p class="indent">The movement of growth is two thousand times
less rapid than the place of the proverbially slow-footed snail.
Taking the average annual growth in height of a tree to be 5 ft.,
it will take a tree a thousand years to cover a distance of a
mile. We take a piece of 2 ft. in the course of half a second,
during the interval plant grows through a length of 1,100,000
part of an inch or half the length of a wave of light. For
investigation on the effect of external conditions on growth we
have to measure even a fraction of that excessively small
length.</p>
<p class="indent">The peasant has eagerly watched the growth of
his plants on which his own life and the world's depend and, even
realised something of its vicissitudes, so the vegetable
physiologist has here one of the many problems of his science.
The invention of growth-measuring instruments has thus been one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id=
"Page_257">[Pg_257]</a></span>of his main endeavours. He has
hitherto succeeded by the use of levers with unequal arms to
obtain a magnification of about 20 times, and even then it takes
many hours for growth to become perceptible; owing to the
practical impossibility of maintaining the external conditions
constant for so many hours, the results of measurement
of growth become vitiated. It is
therefore necessary to produce a magnification so high that
growth should become measurable in less than a minute. The first
improvement effected by the lecturer, now some fourteen years
ago, was his Optical Lever, which at once raised the
magnification from 20 to 1000 times, an advance which at the time
seemed to many incredible, but it is at length coming into use in
advanced laboratories in Europe.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
THE RECORDING CRESCOGRAPH</p>
<p class="indent">A new apparatus devised by the lecturer, the
Recording Crescograph, is described in the Transactions of the
Royal Society, and of the Bose Institute. By a compound system of
levers the magnification is raised to 10,000 but this is not
without great technical difficulties, which cost five years of
efforts to overcome. Thus the levers require to be extremely
light; this was secured by the use of an alloy of aluminium used
in the construction of Zeppelins: this combines lightness with
rigidity. Another difficulty almost unsuperable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id=
"Page_258">[Pg_258]</a></span>arises from the friction at the
bearings of the fulcrum, the best watch jewels made of ruby were
employed, but the supply was cut off from Germany by the war.
This proved a blessing in disguise, for it forced the lecturer to
devise a new principle of suspension using local material. This
was found in practice to be far superior to jewel bearings, which
became clogged by invisible dust particles present in the air.
With this Recording Crescograph many phenomena of extreme
interest have been discovered. The plant itself not only recorded
its normal rate of growth but the slightest change induced in it
by the action of different forces. So delicate was the apparatus
that it analysed growth into a series of pulses, a sudden
shooting out followed by a partial recoil. It showed how the
growth of the plant was retarded by a mere
touch, and the time it took the plant to recover from the effect
of contact, and all these in course of a few seconds. The effect
of different food on growth, the effect of different drugs, or
living capacity these and many more became revealed by the
automatic record made by the plant. This has opened out fresh and
more exact method of medical inquiry, and of practical
agriculture.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
THE MAGNETIC CRESCOGRAPH</p>
<p class="indent">Such unlooked for results called for yet higher
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id=
"Page_259">[Pg_259]</a></span>magnification, and at first it
seemed that further multiplying lever might be added to the
previous system. But this failed on account of added mass and
friction; and some altogether new solution had therefore to be
sought. Material contact having proved unworkable the ideal
weightless and frictionless linking was obtained by introducing a
new magnetic contrivance, and this with the surprising potency of
magnification from 5 to 100 million times. The mind cannot grasp
the meaning of this stupendous magnification; how then could we
translate it in terms which may be understood? Let us take once
more our slow-footed snail, a magnification of ten million times
would convert its speed to something for which there is no
parallel even in modern gunnery practice. The 15 inch cannon of
the "Queen Elizabeth" has a muzzle velocity of 2360 ft. per
second or 8-1/2 million feet per hour. But the speed of the snail
when magnified ten million times would render it 200 million ft.
per hour or 24 times faster than the fastest cannon shot. We may
next turn to the cosmic movement for a parallel: A point in
equator whirls round at the rate of 1037 miles per hour. But a
snail with the magnified speed would beat the earth by going
round 40 times during the period the earth makes but one
revolution!</p>

LIFE <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id=
"Page_260">[Pg_260]</a></span>IN STATE OF SUSPENSE AND ITS
SUBSEQUENT RESOLUTION</p>
<p class="indent">With the experiments carried with the Magnetic
Crescograph life becomes subservient to the will of the
experimenter. The rate of growth is indicated by the speed with
which a spot of indicating light moves across the scale. The
actual rate of growth is fifty thousandth part of an inch per
second; this under magnification is seen by the indicating spot
of light to move at the rate of 36 inches per second: this is the
normal rate. The plant is made to imbibe soda water and the
growth becomes suddenly exalted some ten times; but a puff of
tobacco smoke instantly retards the rate. To induce further
retardation a depressing drug is next applied. The growth
gradually comes to a stop and the quiescent of the spot of light
shows life in a state of suspense. The plant is now hovering in
an unstable poise between life and death, a slight tilt one way,
and life gets interlocked in the
rigidity of death. But the antidote is applied just in time, the
torpor and suspense is over, and life renews her activity once
more with the fullest vigour.</p>
<p class="indent">It is true that man is but poorly provided for
his voyage of discovery in seas unknown, he can hear little and
see less. A single octave of light circumscribes his vision; even
of the visible the size of the ripple of light imposes an
impassable barrier. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id=

limitations but has on the contrary been spurred on its greater

indecipherable for all times: but his untiring and single-minded
pursuit will someday reveal to him the secret that lies behind
the manifestations of life.</p>

THE <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id=
"Page_262">[Pg_262]</a></span>NIGHT-WATCH OF NYMPHAEA</p>
<p class="indent">Sir J. C. Bose gave the following Discourse on
the 'Night-Watch of Nymphaea,' at the Bose Institute, on the 24th
January, 1919.</p>
<p class="indent">[Sir J. C. Bose's discourse delivered at the
Bose Institute, on the 24th January, 1919, dealt with the
mysterious phenomenon of recurrent opening and closure of
flowers. Some of them open in the morning and close in the
evening; others do exactly the opposite opening at night and
closing during the day. These various effects have been described
as the 'waking' and 'sleep' movements of plants. The subject had
attracted the attention of plant physiologists for more than half
a century. After summarising the various results lost in his
recent work says that no satisfactory explanation of the sleep
movements of plants has yet been forthcoming and that the true
theory can only be established after new and exhaustive research.
This investigation has been in progress at Sir J. C. Bose's
laboratory for the last five years; and special automatic
recorders have been invented by means of which <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id=
"Page_263">[Pg_263]</a></span>numerous plants have been recording
their movements for every hour of the day and night and for many
days in succession.]</p>
<p class="indent">In course of his discourse the lecturer said
"The poets have forestalled the men of science. Why does the
water-lily 'Kumud or Nymphaea' keep awake all night long and
close her petals during the day? Because the water-lily is the
lover of the Moon and like the human soul expanding at the touch
of the beloved, the lily opens out her heart at the touch of the
moon beam, and keeps watch all night long; she shrinks affrighted
by the rude touch of the Sun, and closes her petals during the
day. The outer floral leaves of the lily are green, and in the
day time the closed flowers are hardly distinguishable from the
broad green leaves which float on the water. The scene is
transformed in the evening as if by magic, and myriads of
glistening white flowers cover the dark water.</p>
<p class="indent">"The recurrent daily phenomenon has not only
been observed by the poets, but an explanation offered for it. It
is the moonlight then that causes the opening of the lily, and
the sunlight the movement of closure. Had the poet taken out a
lantern in a dark night; he would have noticed that the lily
opened at night in total absence of the moon; but a poet is not
expected to carry a lantern and peep out in the dark; that
inordinate curiosity is characteristic <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id=
"Page_264">[Pg_264]</a></span>only of the man of science. Again
the lily does not close with the appearance of the sun; for the
flower often remains awake up to eleven in the forenoon. A French
dictionary maker saw Cuvier, the Zoologist about the definition
of the crab as 'a little red fish which walks backwards.'
'Admirable,' said Cuvier. 'But the crab is not necessarily
little, nor is it red till boiled; it is not a fish, and it
cannot walk backwards. But with these exceptions your definition
is perfect.' And so also with the poet's description of the
movement of the lily, which does not open to moonlight, nor yet
close to the sun."</p>

THE 'SLEEP' AND 'WAKING' OF JHINGA FLOWER</p>
<p class="indent">The waking and sleeping of the water lily is by
no means an isolated instance. My attention was first drawn to
another remarkable floral display by the folk song which begins
with:</p>
<p class="blockquot">"Our day of work is over<br />
Like life's span, but an hour!<br />
For now behold the gold-started fields<br />
Of opening 'Jhinga' flowers!"</p>
<p class="indent">Since then I witness every afternoon a glorious
transformation in my experimental garden at Sijbaria on the
Ganges. The gardener has planted a large field with Jhinga (Luffa
acutangula). The <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id=
"Page_265">[Pg_265]</a></span>flowers when closed at day time are
very inconspicuous, the lowest whorl of the sepals being dull
green: in my afternoon walk I can hardly recognise the old
familiar field, which is now covered with masses of flower in
their golden glory. Here also the flowers remain open throughout
the night; but they close early in the morning and the fairy
field of cloth of gold vanishes suddenly.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
COMPLEXITY OF THE PROBLEM</p>
<p class="indent">The revolutions made by the plant-scripts led
to the discovery of certain new and unsuspected reactions in the
life of plants, notably the influence of variation of temperature
in modifying the geotropic curvature.
There are at least ten variables, which by their joint effects
give rise to over a thousand variations in the resulting movement
of plants. The effect of each of these different factors has been
isolated and a new theory propounded which offers a complete
explanation of the so called sleep movements. The life reactions
of plants to the various stimuli of the environment was most
strikingly illustrated by means of supersensitive Magnetic
Crescograph. The plant was shown to perceive the shock of light,
to which it made an answering signal, so also to the action of
warmth and cold. And it was explained how the various
combinations of effects induced by environmental <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id=
"Page_266">[Pg_266]</a></span>change found diverse expressions in
the movement of plants.</p>
<p class="indent">The scientific explanations offered for the
opening and closing of the water lily is that the flower is
closed under sunlight and that the
opening takes place under darkness. But Prof. Bose has been able
to keep the lily awake even in day time by placing it in a cool
place. Simultaneous record of the movement of the flower and the
thermograph of daily variation of temperature proved conclusively
that a rapid fall of temperature in the evening brought about the
opening of the flower, at first slowly then rapidly, and by 10
p.m. the flower was fully expanded. About 6 a.m. in the morning
there is a rise of temperature, and the reverse movement of
closure sets in. The flower continues to close very rapidly the
sleep movement of closure is complete by about 10 a.m.</p>
<p class="indent">It will be seen how different flowers through
their sensitiveness to heat and cold execute movements of "sleep"
or of "waking." Some of them have the healthy habit of normal
humanity to sleep at night and keep awake at day-time. Others
turn night into day, and make up for their long night watch
by sleeping it off at the
day-time.</p>

WOUNDED <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id=

<p class="indent">Sir J. C. Bose delivered the following lecture
on the 'Wounded Plants' at the Bose Institute, on the 7th
February, 1919:&mdash;</p>
<p class="indent">It is a little over four years now that the
Embodiment of World Tragedy stalked over Western Europe. The fair
field of France and the bright sky was under a pall of
battle-smoke. Our sight could not penetrate through the dense
gloom, and the mortal cry of the wounded and dying, drowned by
hoarse roar of a thousand did not reach our ear. But from the
time the Sikh and the Pathan, the Gurkha and the Bengali, the
Mahratta and the Rajput flung themselves in front of battle from
that day our perception has become intensified. The distant cry
of those whose life-blood has crimsoned the white field of snow,
has found reverberating echo in our heart. What is that subtle
bond by which all distances are bridged over, and by which an
individual life becomes merged in larger life? Sympathy is that
bond by which we come to realise the unity of all life. Before us
are spread multitudinous plants, silent and seemingly impassive.
They too <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id=
"Page_268">[Pg_268]</a></span>like us are actors in the Cosmic
drama of life, like us the play thing of destiny. In their
checkered life, light and darkness, the warmth of summer and
frost of winter, drought and rain, the gentle breeze and whirling
tornadoes, life and death alternate. Various shocks impinge on
them, but no cry is raised in answer. I shall nevertheless try to
decipher some chapters of their life history.</p>
<p class="indent">When a man receives a blow or shock of any
kind, his answering cry makes us realise that he is hurt, but a
mute makes no outcry. How do we realise his sufferings? We know
it by his agonised look by the convulsive movement of his limbs,
and through fellow-feeling realise his pain. When a frog is
struck it does not cry, but its limbs show convulsive movement.
But from this it does not follow that the frog is not hurt, for
some would urge that there is a great gap between us and lower
animals. One who feels for the humblest of His creatures alone
knows whether the frog is hurt or not. Human sympathy always
aspires: it is sometimes extended to equals, hardly ever to
inferiors. And so it happens that many would doubt, whether the
lowly and the depressed possess the fine sense of the exalted to
feel the same joy and sorrow, and to resent social tyranny. When
human attitude is so finely discriminative as regards different
grades of his own species, it might be <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id=
"Page_269">[Pg_269]</a></span>extravagant to believe that the
frog could have any consciousness of pain. A concession might
however be made that the frog perceives a shock to which it
responds by convulsive movements. It is as well that we should be
careful about the use of terms for an eminent biologist insisted
that animals never felt any pain: when an oyster is swallowed
alive, it did not, according to him, feel any pain but rather a
sensation of grateful warmth at contact with the alimentary
tract. The question will remain undecided for no one has as yet
returned from the gastric cavity of the tiger to expatiate on the
exquisite sensation.</p>

TEST OF LIVINGNESS</p>
<p class="indent">Responsive movements being a test of life, we
shall try to construct a scale with which the height of
livingness may be measured. What is the difference between the
living and the dead? The living answers to a shock from without;
the most lively gives the most energetic, the torpid or dying the
feeblest, and the dead no answer at all. Thus life may be tested
by shocks from without, the size of the answer being the gauge of
vitality. The answer of the strong will be violent and almost
explosive in its intensity, while the weakling will barely protest. The responsive movements may be
recorded by suitable apparatus. The successive responses to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id=
"Page_270">[Pg_270]</a></span>similar shocks will remain uniform,
if the living tissue remained always the same. But the living
organism is always in a state of change for environment is always
building us anew, and we are changing everyday of our life. We
are thus subject to change, some day we are in a state of high
exuberance, and other time in a state of lowest depression: we
pass through numerous phases between the two extremes. Not merely
does the present modify, but there is also the subtle impress of
memory of the past. The sum total of all these characterise one
individual from another. How is the hidden to be made manifest?
To test the genuineness of a coin, we strike it and the
sound response betrays the true from the false. The genuine rings
true and the other gives a false note. In this way perhaps the
inner history of different lives may be revealed by shocks and
the resulting response.</p>
<p style=

EFFECT OF WOUND</p>
<p class="indent">There are three separate investigations that
have been carried out on the effect of wound on plants: The first
is the shock effect of wound on growth: this generally speaking
retards or arrests growth. In the second series of investigations
the change of spontaneous pulsation of the leaflet of the
Telegraph plant was recorded. Death begins to spread from the cut
end of the leaflet, and reaches the throbbing <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id=
"Page_271">[Pg_271]</a></span>tissue which becomes permanently
stilled on cessation of life. Experiments are in progress of
arrest their march of death, and the cut leaflet which died in 24
hours has now been kept alive for more than a week.</p>
<p style=
"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0em; margin-top: 2.0em">
PARALYSIS OF SENSIBILITY</p>
<p class="indent">Another series of investigations were carried
out on the paralysing effect of severe wound. A leaf of Mimosa
was cut off from the plant, and the subsequent histories of the
wounded plant and the detached leaf are curiously different. The
cutting of one of its leaves had caused a great shock to the
parent plant, and an intense excitation spreads over to the
distant organs. All the leaves remained depressed and
irresponsive for several hours. From this state of paralysed
sensibility, the plant gradually recovers and the leaves begin to
show returning sensitiveness. The detached leaf, when placed in a
nourishing solution soon recovers, and holds up its head with an
attitude indicative of defiance, and the responses it gives are
energetic. This lasts for twenty four hours, after which a
curious change creeps in the vigour of its responses begins
rapidly to wane. The leaf hitherto erect, falls over; death had
at last asserted its mastery.</p>
